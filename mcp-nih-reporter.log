      "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nHIV/AIDS is at epidemic proportions in Zambia, where approximately 1.2 million people \u2013 representing about\n12% of the country's adult population \u2013 are infected. Concomitant with this epidemic, the widespread\navailability of free anti-retroviral treatment in-country has increased the lifespan of HIV-1 infected individuals,\nresulting in prolonged chronic immunosuppression and increased occurrence of HIV-associated cancers.\nHowever, in-country efforts to prevent, diagnose, and manage cancer in Zambia have been hindered by a lack\nof laboratory facilities, insufficient cancer research infrastructure, and a shortage of trained personnel.\nRecognizing these critical gaps, the University of Zambia School of Medicine, the University Teaching\nHospitals, and the University of Nebraska-Lincoln leveraged the success of a previous Fogarty partnership to\nestablish the AIDS Malignancies Training and Research International Program (AMTRIP) in collaboration with\na new lead partner, the Cancer Diseases Hospital (CDH). This unique program aims to enhance Zambia's\ncancer research infrastructure and capacity by training Zambian biomedical researchers and health care\nproviders in laboratory techniques and research methodology related to basic cancer biology, molecular\ngenomics, and bioinformatics. Now in its fifth year, AMTRIP has made significant strides by providing intensive\nlong-term graduate degree training and short- and medium-term technical training for a diverse group of 25\ntrainees; hosting workshops for over 300 health care professionals; successfully transitioning trainees into\nmentorship roles; adapting program activities to meet the needs of trainees and the rapidly changing cancer\nresearch landscape; and leveraging partnerships with other D43 programs to expand the program's impact.\nBuilding on these accomplishments, this renewal application seeks to further enhance cancer research\ncapacity in Zambia by: 1) continuing to provide long-term academic instruction and research experiences for\neight current master's and three current PhD students in Zambia and recruiting four additional master's and\ntwo additional PhD students; 2) providing medium-term (six months to one year) technical training for trainees\nin topics related to molecular pathology, cancer biology, bioinformatics and genomics; and 3) delivering short-\nterm training (less than three months) and technical workshops (3-5 days) designed to enhance basic, clinical,\nimplementation, genomics, bioinformatics, and behavioral cancer research in collaboration with other regional\npartners and programs. Expected outcomes of this renewal include the graduation of eight current master's\nand three current PhD candidates; recruitment and training of an additional four master's and two PhD\nstudents in relevant cancer research fields; the transition of trainees into mentorship roles; enhanced\ninfrastructure at Zambian institutions, including the completion of a CDH laboratory renovation; and expanded\npartnerships with other D43 programs. Given current progress and anticipated renewal outcomes, AMTRIP is\non track to transition program leadership to the next generation of cancer researchers in a future renewal.",

      "phr_text": "NARRATIVE\nWhile AIDS-associated cancers are a major cause of death around the globe, those in low- and middle-income\ncountries (LMICs), particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, are much more likely to die from cancer due to shortages\nof trained cancer researchers, oncologists, and support staff and a lack of healthcare infrastructure and\nexpertise for diagnosing and treating cancers. The AIDS Malignancies Training and Research International\nProgram (AMTRIP) seeks to address these challenges by training a cadre of Zambian basic biomedical\nresearchers and practitioners from the Cancer Diseases Hospital (the main LMIC institution) and partnering\norganizations in the skills necessary to further the country's research agenda in cancer biology and genomics,\nwhich will translate to better clinical care for cancer patients. Upon completion of master's and doctoral\ntraining, program fellows will be provided employment in Zambian medical institutions in order to begin\naddressing these challenges in-country.",

      "abstract_text": "Glial tumors are the most commonly occurring malignant brain tumor in the United States, among which approximately 20% are glioblastomas, which are the most aggressive and practically incurable. Drug resistance is often associated with the existence of a discrete population of cells, which demonstrate a stemlike phenotype. In glioblastoma, these cells are known as glioma initialing cells (GICs), and their expansion is often linked with tumor recurrence. Human endogenous retroviral sequences (HERVs) are mobile elements of the viral origin that comprise nearly 8% of the human genome. In HERVs, like in all retroviruses, genes encoding viral proteins are flanked by long terminal repeats (LTRs). Serving as promoters, LTRs are particularly enriched in binding motifs for transcription factors. Importantly, recent studies show that HERV transcripts are upregulated during early human development, including CNS development, when cellular pluripotency and stem-like phenotype predominate. Reactivation of HERV loci are also associated with different tumors, however, the cause and effect relationship between HERVs and cancer have not been established. Therefore, the effect/s of HERVs on the development and maintenance of stem-like phenotype in glioblastoma tumors, and the associated drug resistance, require further investigation. We hypothesize that aberrant expression of HERVs found in glioblastoma clinical samples contributes to the enhanced glioblastoma stem-like phenotype and associated drug resistance. We will test this general hypothesis by executing our experimental plan that consists of two independent but logically connected Specific Aims: In Aim 1 we will determine HERV transcript levels in glial tumors, and analyze if high HERV transcription correlates with: a) specific glioblastoma subtype: pro-neural (17 months survival), classical (14 months survival), mesenchymal (11.5 months survival), as compared to low-grade gliomas (90% curable); b) glioblastoma stem-specific transcription pattern. In Aim 2 we will analyze effects of inducible Crisp/Cas-based -upregulation and -downregulation of HERV transcripts on stem-like phenotype and malignant growth of low grade gliomas and glioblastomas, respectively. The long-term objective is to establish the role of HERV transcripts in establishing highly malignant phenotype of glioblastoma, and to use this knowledge in the development of new therapeutic strategies against these terminal brain neoplasms.",

      "abstract_text": "Abstract\nThe primary purpose of this Ruth L. Kirschstein NRSA F30 application is to provide the framework that will\nprepare the applicant for a successful career as a physician scientist. Much of the applicant\u2019s career development\nwill come from work in electronic cigarette (eCig) inhalation-induced cardiopulmonary dysfunction research, and\nshe will be provided the invaluable opportunity to carry out high quality research using a murine model of chronic\nintermittent eCig vapor exposure. Cardiopulmonary diseases are the leading causes of death worldwide, and\ncigarette smoking remains the most significant and preventable risk factor. While cigarette smoking prevalence\nhas steadily declined since 1950, there has been a recent drastic increase in the popularity of eCig or electronic\nnicotine delivery systems (ENDS). Despite the perception that these products are \u201csafer\u201d alternatives to cigarette\nsmoking, recent cases of eCig or vaping product use-associated lung injury, denoted EVALI, demonstrate a\nstrong potential for harm. The impact of eCig on cardiopulmonary function has yet to be fully elucidated; however,\nthe applicant\u2019s mentoring team demonstrated that chronic nicotine vapor inhalation alone induces activation of\nthe renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and pulmonary hypertension (PH) in mice. Furthermore, preliminary data\nfor this proposal indicate nicotine induces vascular dysfunction. While the previous study demonstrates that\nnicotine has detrimental cardiopulmonary impacts, it is unknown if the addition of other eCig components (e.g.\npropylene glycol/vegetable glycerin) will produce the same or greater harmful effects. Thus, investigation into\nthe possible synergistic activity of eCig additives with nicotine is warranted. The OBJECTIVE of this proposal is\nto evaluate the effects of chronic eCig vapor inhalation on cardiopulmonary function, which could contribute to\nEVALI, in a murine model of chronic eCig vapor inhalation. The proposed HYPOTHESIS is that chronic eCig\nvapor inhalation disrupts RAS homeostasis, leading to vascular dysfunction, PH, and right ventricular\n(RV) remodeling. The proposed study will employ a wide variety of state-of-the-art tools and techniques to test\nthe hypothesis using two specific aims: (1) Chronic eCig vapor inhalation promotes vascular dysfunction, PH,\nand RV remodeling, and (2) Mechanisms of chronic eCig vapor inhalation-induced cardiopulmonary dysfunction\ndepend on RAS activation and angiotensin signaling mediated by the angiotensin type I receptor (AT1R). In\naddition, this study will investigate if blocking angiotensin receptor signaling with Losartan will protect against\neCig vapor inhalation-induced cardiopulmonary dysfunction. Findings from this study will advance our\nunderstanding of the detrimental effects of eCig on the cardiopulmonary system and may identify novel\ntherapeutic targets for the treatment of eCig related cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases (CVPD). With the\nsupport of a strong multidisciplinary mentoring team, completion of the proposed training plan will ensure that\nthe applicant is ready to embark on a career in academic medicine.",

      "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY:\nFor women in the United States, breast cancer is the most common malignancy and the second leading cause\nof death. In this application, we focus upon a specific subtype of breast cancer known as triple-negative breast\ncancer (TNBC). Compared to other breast cancer subtypes, TNBC is considered more aggressive and extremely\ndifficult to treat with standard therapies. As a result, it has a high recurrence rate and a high overall mortality rate.\nTNBC accounts for up to 20% of all breast cancers, with a higher incidence in ethnic minority populations and\nyoung women (usually <40 years of age). Approximately 70% of patients with advanced TNBC die of disease\nrecurrence and/or metastasis within 5 years of initial diagnosis. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the medical\ncommunity to develop more effective therapeutic options for this deadly disease.\nIn this project, we will investigate a novel experimental compound, named LG007, for its anti-cancer activity in\nTNBC. Of significance, we will utilize robust TNBC Patient-Derived Xenograft (PDX) mouse models to study the\nin vivo efficacy of LG007. Our preliminary results demonstrated that LG007 effectively inhibits TNBC tumor\ngrowth and metastasis. Notably, we found that LG007 treatment could robustly shrink large human-derived\nTNBC PDX tumors, with a near-complete response. These preliminary results strongly support the premise that\nLG007 is a novel and potent drug candidate capable of treating progressive TNBC and associated metastasis.\nFurthermore, we demonstrated that LG007 is able to target and regulate miR-10b, a well-known oncogenic\nmiRNA that promotes tumor development and metastasis. Therefore, we hypothesize that miR-10b is a primary\ntarget of LG007 that is critically involved in the molecular mechanisms of action by which LG007 inhibits tumor\ngrowth and metastasis. Three specific aims are proposed in pursuit of the project\u2019s objective to develop a new\ntherapy for the treatment of TNBC. In Aim 1, we will determine the mechanistic roles of miR-10b and one of its\ntargets, NR4A3, in the anti-TNBC activity of LG007. In Aim 2, we will investigate the in vivo efficacy of LG007\nutilizing a variety of advanced mouse models that mimic the clinical setting of TNBC and its associated\nrecurrence and metastasis. In Aim 3, we will characterize the pharmacological and toxicological properties of\nLG007 in preparation for future translation to clinical testing. We expect that the results obtained from this study\nwill lead to the development of a novel, safe, and effective treatment for patients with advanced TNBC.",

      "abstract_text": "Abstract\nThe primary purpose of this Ruth L. Kirschstein NRSA F30 application is to provide the groundwork that will\nprepare the applicant for an academic medical career. Much of the applicant\u2019s career development will come\nfrom work in High Priority HIV/AIDS comorbidity-related research, and she will have the invaluable opportunity\nto carry out high quality research using a well-established preclinical model of chronic binge alcohol (CBA) and\nsimian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection. At-risk alcohol use is twice as likely in people living with HIV\n(PLWH) as it is in the general population. PLWH on antiretroviral therapy (ART) have a near normal life\nexpectancy, but there is an increase in prevalence of metabolic comorbidities, requiring a need for research\nstudying pathophysiological mechanisms of metabolic dysregulation in the context of HIV. Studies from our group\nhave shown that at-risk alcohol use and CBA is associated with impaired insulin/glucose dynamics in PLWH and\nin SIV-infected macaques, respectively. Skeletal muscle (SKM) is a major site of insulin-dependent glucose\nuptake, and preclinical studies indicate that alcohol decreases SKM insulin sensitivity. Preliminary data\ngenerated for this application suggest that CBA dysregulates proteins in the insulin signaling pathway in SKM,\nfurther indicating that alcohol leads to SKM dysfunction. With previous work from our group demonstrating that\nCBA-mediated alterations in myotubes reflect what is seen in SKM, we will utilize cultured myotubes to reflect\nchanges seen in SKM in our proposed experiments. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) mediate cellular changes in\npathologic and therapeutic conditions by transporting bioactive cargo, including microRNAs (miRNAs), between\ncells. miRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression and are differentially expressed by\nCBA and insulin resistance. Preliminary and previous data suggests that CBA leads to lower expression of the\nSKM specific miRNA-206 in plasma EVs and the SKM of SIV-infected macaques, and miRNA-206 is implicated\nin SKM insulin-dependent glucose uptake. Taken together, our preliminary data and published literature support\nthe hypothesis, that alcohol-mediated alterations in myotube extracellular vesicle miRNA cargo contribute\nto decreased myotube insulin sensitivity in SIV infection. The proposed study will employ a wide variety of\nstate-of- the-art techniques to test the hypothesis using two specific aims: (1) CBA-administration alters myotube-\nderived EV profile in SIV-infected macaques, and (2) myotube-derived EV miRNA cargo of CBA-administered\nSIV-infected macaques decreases myotube insulin sensitivity. Findings from the proposed studies will provide\ninsight on the role of EVs in alcohol-mediated SKM insulin insensitivity in SIV infection. Additionally, the proposed\nproject aims to illustrate the therapeutic potential of EVs in improving alcohol-mediated SKM dysfunction. With\na strong mentoring team committed to developing a well-rounded physician scientist, completion of the proposed\ntraining plan in High Priority HIV/AIDS comorbidity-related research will ensure that the applicant is ready to\nembark on a career in academic medicine.",

      "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nHeart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) has emerged as a significant unmet medical need in\ncardiovascular medicine and 60% of all new heart failure diagnoses are HFpEF. The increasing prevalence of\nHFpEF coupled with a complete lack of effective FDA approved treatments further accentuates this critical public\nhealth problem. It is well appreciated that chronic over-activation of the sympathetic nervous system promotes\nleft ventricular (LV) hypertrophic remodeling and fibrosis, profound endothelial and vascular injury, and renal\ndysfunction.\nThe proposed studies will evaluate the beneficial effects of renal denervation (RDN) on left ventricular and\nvascular function in a novel swine model of HFpEF. HFpEF will be induced in G\u00f6ttingen mini-swine following\nchronic treatment with deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) combined with a Western Diet that induces\nhypertension and metabolic syndrome followed by LV diastolic dysfunction, pulmonary congestion, exercise\nintolerance, and clinically relevant HFpEF. RDN will be performed following the onset of HFpEF utilizing a\nclinical RDN catheter system that employs RF energy to destroy the renal sympathetic nerves.\nThe Central Hypothesis of the proposed studies is that RDN therapy will promote myocardial repair and attenuate\nHFpEF progression via downregulation of pathological signaling in the kidney and heart.\nSpecific Aim 1 is to determine the effects of RDN therapy on heart failure progression and severity in a\nclinically relevant large animal model of HFpEF.\nSpecific Aim 2 is to identify candidate cardiac and extra-cardiac mediators that underlie the\ncardioprotective effects of RDN using genomic, metabolomic, and proteomic approaches.\nThese studies will determine if RDN ameliorates the severity and progression of HFpEF and explore the\nmechanisms by which RDN exerts cardioprotective and vascular protective effects. These studies will involve an\narray of physiological, biochemical, genomic, metabolomic, and proteomic approaches to assess the potential\nefficacy of RDN in HFpEF. Results from these studies will significantly extend our current understanding of the\npathobiology of HFpEF and provide critical information that helps to guide the development of novel therapies to\ntreat patients that suffer from HFpEF.",

We will investigate the beneficial effects of RDN in a\nclinically relevant animal model of HF and the results of these studies will guide the development of novel HF\ntherapies.",

We expect that the trauma burden will impact chronic diseases through DNA\nmethylation (DNAm) age acceleration. The WaTCH cohort is an important, highly trauma-\nexposed sample of women uniquely poised for a third wave of data collection that continues\nassessing trauma exposure, depression, PTSD, social context, physical health, and collection of\nan additional blood specimen eight years after the baseline to examine of DNAm age. Aim 1 will\ninvestigate disparities in psychological health (PTSD, depression), physical health (diabetes,\nhypertension, and cancer), and DNAm age acceleration as women age, particularly as\ninfluenced by cumulative trauma burden. Aim 2 will examine the influences of contextual\nvariables, including social capital and financial strain, that may mediate or moderate the effects\nof cumulative trauma burden on adverse psychological and physical health outcomes. Aim 3 will\nexplore the mediating effects of DNAm age acceleration on physical and mental health\noutcomes.\nThe proposed study will use the WaTCH cohort of 2800 women exposed to the Deepwater\nHorizon Oil Spill in coastal Louisiana in 2010. It will entail the third wave of data and\nbiospecimen collection and incorporate data already gathered through two previous waves of\ndata collection. Self-reported health data on demographic, income and financial stressors, oil\nspill exposure, neighborhood context, social capital, health behaviors, trauma history,\npsychological symptoms, and physical health will be collected through telephone interviews.\nRepeat blood samples will be collected from up to 1058 women with baseline samples.",

      "abstract_text": "Enhancing Mask/ANKHD1 activity to protect against Tau-induced neurodegeneration\nAbstract\nA common pathophysiological feature of both inherited and sporadic neurodegenerative\ndiseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease is the cytoplasmic accumulation of inclusions containing\naggregate-prone proteins such as Tau. Mounting evidence also suggested that such abnormal\ninclusions in neurons and glial cells of neurodegenerative disease patients can spread across\ncellular boundaries within the nervous system in a prion-like manner. Therefore, enhancing the\nclearance of the toxic protein aggregates holds tremendous therapeutic potential for treating\nneurodegeneration. We found that upregulating Mask \u2013 a conserved Ankyrin repeats and KH\ndomain protein (the human homologue is called ANKHD1) \u2013 in fly neurological disease model\nmarkedly suppresses human mutant Tau-, FUS- and TDP-43-induced degeneration. We next\nobtained biochemical, cellular, and genetic evidence that Mask is both necessary and sufficient\nto promote clearance of ubiquitinated proteins, and it does so by promoting lysosomal\nacidification and enhancing the flux of autophagy. We also found that the mammalian\nhomologue of Mask, ANKHD1, may also promote autophagic flux. These results led us to\nhypothesize that enhancing Mask/ANKHD1 activity promotes the autophagy/lysosomal\npathway, which has an overall beneficial effect in removing of toxic protein aggregates, and\ntherefore may have the potential to be further developed and tested as a therapeutic strategy for\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease. This grant aims to test 1) whether Mask-mediated promotion of lysosomal\nfunction suppresses neurodegeneration induced by human Tau in flies; and 2) whether\nANKHD1 co-expression suppresses neuron-specific degeneration induced by human mutated\nTau in mouse models.",

At-risk alcohol use among people\nliving with HIV (PLWH) is nearly twice that in the general population. Chronic at-risk alcohol use and HIV/SIV\nare independently associated with metabolic comorbidities including skeletal muscle (SKM) dysfunction. Based\non our published and preliminary data, the global hypothesis of this work is that decreased peroxisome\nproliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator (PGC)-1\u03b2 underlies chronic binge alcohol (CBA)-mediated\ndecreases in mitochondrial biogenesis and function in SKM of SIV+ female rhesus macaques and that PGC-1\u03b2\nis a potential therapeutic target to improve mitochondrial homeostasis.

There is currently no pharmacological treatment for ID patients. Gene-association\nstudies in ID patients identified an increasing number of genes. However, a vast gap persists\nbetween gene discovery and treatment due to our poor understanding of the molecular\nmechanisms linking cognition and genes. Two ID-linked genes are PPP2R5C and PPP2R5D,\nboth encoding brain-enriched B56 regulatory subunits of the PP2A phosphatase complex.\nHowever, it is unclear how the ID-linked mutations in PPP2R5C or PPP2R5D affect the B56\nsubunit action and subsequent cognitive function. Our studies on wrd, the sole fly orthologue of\nboth PPP2R5C and PPP2R5D, shed light on how these specific subunits of PP2A\nphosphatases regulate synaptic development, neural-activity-driven synaptic structural\nremodeling, learning and memory. We found that Wrd-PP2A mediates dephosphorylation\nevents crucial for structural plasticity at the nerve terminals. Loss of wrd function destabilizes\nactive zones at the larval glutamatergic neuromuscular junctions, diminishes light-induced\nremodeling of active zones at the photoreceptor synapses, and impairs gustatory learning in the\nadult stage. Transiently expressing Wrd protein in adulthood restores the gustatory learning\ndefect in the wrd null mutant flies. These findings together suggest an exciting potential for\nboosting Wrd-PP2A activity (or inhibiting antagonizing kinases of Wrd-PP2A) as a treatment for\nID. In this grant, we propose to generate and study fly Wrd transgenes that mimic the ID-linked\nmutations in human patients. Our study will establish a fly model to dissect the molecular\nmechanisms underlying the root causes of B56-dependent cognitive dysfunctions, paving the\nroad for future therapeutic approaches in treating B56-linked and other forms of ID.",

      "abstract_text": "Abstract Alcohol-mediated mitochondrial adaptations in skeletal muscle: role of Sirtuin1\nThe goal of this Ruth L.\nKirschstein\nNRSA F32 application is to prepare the applicant for an academic career as\nan alcohol researcher. The applicant will have the invaluable opportunity to be trained in alcohol research, and\ntransition from basic science research to translational research. Alcohol-induced skeletal muscle dysfunction\naffects 50% of individuals with alcohol use disorder. Skeletal muscle mitochondrial dysfunction is a salient\nmechanism contributing to myopathy and data from the laboratory demonstrates that alcohol increases reactive\noxygen species production and reduces mitochondrial membrane potential in primary skeletal muscle myoblasts.\nHowever, the alcohol-mediated specific mechanisms leading to impaired bioenergetic capacity and disrupted\ncellular redox homeostasis in skeletal muscle remain incompletely understood. Sirtuin-1 (SIRT1), a NAD+-\ndependent class-III protein deacetylase, regulates mitochondrial dynamics, biogenesis, and bioenergetic\ncapacity. The inhibition of SIRT1 is correlated with increased mitochondrial fission, and exercise-induced\nincreases in NAD+ levels increase skeletal muscle SIRT1 activity, positively influencing energy metabolism. We\npostulate that these alterations arise from increased mitochondrial fission, driven by decreased Sirt1 activity.\nPreliminary data generated for this application indicate that in differentiated primary human myotubes, electrical\npulse stimulation increases ethanol-induced reductions in Sirt1 activity. However, the precise mechanisms by\nwhich Sirt1-induced deacetylation impacts mitochondrial dynamics and contributes to alcohol-mediated\ndysregulated skeletal muscle bioenergetics remain incompletely understood. Taken together, preliminary data\nand published literature provide evidence of alcohol-mediated mitochondrial adaptations leading to skeletal\nmuscle dysfunction. We hypothesize that alcohol dysregulates mitochondrial bioenergetics in myotubes derived\nfrom humans by increasing mitochondrial fission and reducing mitochondrial respiration, in a Sirt1 dependent\nmanner. Additionally, we propose to explore the potential of electrical pulse stimulation to identify the alcohol-\nassociated mitochondrial dysfunction mechanisms that can be positively influenced by exercise. With a strong\nmentoring team, including clinician scientists, completion of the proposed training plan in alcohol-related\nresearch will ensure that the applicant is equipped for a successful career in alcohol translational research.",

      "abstract_text": "Abstract\nTraumatic brain injury (TBI) affects millions of otherwise healthy individuals annually. A significant risk factor for\nTBI is alcohol intoxication, with 30-50% of TBI cases in the US attributed to alcohol-intoxication at the time of\ninjury, potentially intensifying cognitive deficits and TBI-related disability, particularly in moderate to severe\ncases. Moreover, following TBI, approximately 25% of TBI patients resume alcohol consumption, which can\nalso contribute to neuropathological outcomes. Several mechanisms can contribute to greater injury in alcohol\nand TBI comorbid conditions. Prior work from our laboratory has shown enhanced neuroinflammation at site of\nTBI in rodents exposed to alcohol, and delayed recovery of neurobehavioral function in TBI followed by alcohol\nexposure. Enhanced neuroinflammation may be the result of mitochondrial components or metabolic\nbyproducts that act as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Alcohol and TBI both alter cellular\nmetabolism, affects mitochondrial function and glutathione availability. The TBI and alcohol associated\ndisruption in brain metabolism, requires metabolic flexibility in energy substrate utilization to maintain adequate\nATP production. This metabolic shift may lead to glutathione depletion and reactive oxygen species\noverproduction, triggering cell death and accentuated neuropathology that can significantly impact recovery\nfrom TBI. Based on these data, we hypothesize that alcohol exacerbates TBI-induced alterations in\nmitochondrial bioenergetics; particularly at the site of injury, leading to increased oxidative stress and cell\ndeath. Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent programmed cell death mechanism, is highly sensitive to mitochondrial\nbioenergetic alterations and is reported in TBI. The research-training plan proposes three specific aims to test\nthe hypothesis that a) alcohol impairs mitochondrial bioenergetics at the site of TBI injury, b) alcohol\naccentuates oxidative stress affecting predominantly astrocytes at the site of TBI, c) and that ferroptosis is a\nsignificant contributor to cell death at the TBI site. The applicant will leverage his background training in\nmitochondrial mechanisms of tissue injury, translating them from cardiac tissue to the brain and from ischemic\ninjury to TBI, with emphasis of the role of alcohol in exacerbating these pathophysiological mechanisms.",

SCMM prides itself on bringing a critical mass of medical\nmycology researchers together from the south central region of the United States to share the\nlatest research being conducted in the various labs, provide opportunities for collaboration, and\npromote the development of junior trainees in participating laboratories. The meeting site rotates\nbetween university-centered locations in the south central region where fungal-centric\nlaboratories are located. Principal Investigators and students/postdocs from ~15 laboratories\nusually attend annually (including laboratories in the host city). In total there are upwards of 20\nlaboratories that have attended one or more of the meetings depending on the location site. A\nstrong and growing critical mass of medical mycologists have supported this meeting and led to\nits longevity and significance over the past 20 years. Although the meeting format has evolved\nover the years, the current format has focused on oral presentations by trainees regarding their\nmost exciting and impactful unpublished data. The small group setting provides a welcoming\nenvironment that has been successful in promoting discussion and constructive feedback for\ntrainees. Hence, the primary objectives of the meeting are to 1) bring regionally-based medical\nmycologists together to share research, initiate collaborations, and provide a venue for trainees\nto present their latest work, and 2) promote the development of young/junior scientists as a\nmentoring tool to facilitate their transition into academic scientists or their chosen career path.\nThe funding request is for trainee travel awards (n=10), costs of the venue, and to partially\ncover travel costs for the keynote speaker.",

      "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nAfrican Americans have both the highest incidence and mortality of lung cancer compared to any\nother racial/ethnic group. A possible explanation for this disparity is that African Americans (AA)\nmay be less likely to utilize preventative screenings such as Low-dose computed tomography\n(LDCT), which has the potential to encourage smokers to quit smoking successfully. In 2021, the\nUSPSTF expanded their lung cancer screening (LCS) recommendations to include individuals\nages 50-80 years with at least a 20 pack-year history, increasing the number of eligible U.S.\nadults. While the expanded criteria are expected to increase the number of high-risk individuals\neligible for screening and reduce lung cancer mortality, the impact on racial and ethnic minorities,\nincluding African Americans, has shown mixed findings. This is problematic as previous research\nhas found that African Americans may have different quit behaviors than whites. While use of\nLCS as a teachable moment for tobacco cessation is important, currently, there is no well-\nintegrated, comprehensive, culturally relevant community-engaged, sustainable program. Still, it\nis not clear whether the synergy effect of smoking cessation and LDCT LCS intervention was\nobserved in both quitting behaviors and LDCT uptake among African-American smokers. To\naddress this urgent public health concern, this study aims to reduce disparities and the burden of\nlung cancer among AA smokers by supporting a Multiple-level intervention integrating lung cancer\nscreening and smoking cessation(MILS), followed the NIH DEIA strategies using multilevel\ninterventions that impact determinants of health and address health disparities at appropriate time\npoints across the life course. Aim 1) Investigate smokers' and providers' attitudes, knowledge,\nand experiences with the expanded 2021 USPSTF LCS recommendations. Aim 2) Compare the\neffectiveness of a MILS vs. usual care on the biochemically-validated 7-day point-prevalence\ntobacco abstinence rates, LDCT uptake, nicotine dependence and stage of change was\nassessed. Aim 3) Explore barriers and facilitators that influence primary outcomes at the\ncommunity, provider, and individual levels for the improvement of a multilevel intervention. To\ndate, no study has evaluated the synergy effect of smoking cessation intervention and LDCT LCS\nin AA populations with multilevel strategies. We will move the field forward by providing effective,\nscalable interventions to improve both smoking cessation and LDCT lung cancer screening\nadherence to reduce health disparities promised by large clinical trials that motivated screening\nguidelines. The results of the study will directly guide the development of targeted strategies to\nimprove lung cancer screening rates among minorities.",

      "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT\nPeople living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (PLWH) remain at increased risk of developing\nhead and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC) due to oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, despite\nadequate management of HIV with effective antiretroviral therapy (ART). Clinical observations have indicated\nincreased risk of oral HPV infection and pathology in PLWH after they begin taking ART and concurrent with a\nsignificant drop in HIV viral burden. Prior in vitro studies using 3D experimental tissue models that mimic stratified\nsquamous epithelium have suggested that exposure of the tissue to ART agents disrupts the structural integrity\nof the tissue and enhances susceptibility to HPV infection. These findings have not been corroborated in clinical\nstudies using relevant oral mucosal samples from PLWH. We hypothesize that ART damages the integrity of the\noral mucosa and enhances acquisition of HPV infection in vivo. Further, we posit that individuals that are taking\nART for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent HIV infection will exhibit tissue damage and HPV\nsusceptibility similar to that of PLWH who are taking ART to manage their HIV infection. Three specific aims are\nproposed to investigate these hypotheses: 1) to compare the prevalence and incidence of oral HPV infection in\nPLWH taking ART and people taking ART for PrEP to risk-matched HIV seronegative, ART-na\u00efve controls; 2) to\nexamine the architecture of oral mucosal tissue in subjects taking ART/PrEP for evidence of damage to the\nintegrity of the mucosal barrier; and 3) to determine the effect of taking ART/PrEP on tissue susceptibility to HPV\ninfection by experimental challenge of patient oral biopsy-derived 3D tissues with HPV16 in vitro. These studies\nwill, for the first time, discern the role of ART apart from HIV infection on oral mucosa integrity and susceptibility\nto oral HPV infection. This is significant because understanding the interplay between HIV, ART and HPV will\nreveal new opportunities to prevent HNSCC that take into consideration the effects of ART on patient risk.",

      "abstract_text": "Pancreatic cancer is a lethal malignancy. Even with surgical resection, the recurrence rate is high, and chemotherapy is recommended for all patients due to the systemic nature of the disease. A major treatment challenge is the high rate of resistance to the available treatments. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop novel treatment modalities with effective and durable responses. Immunotherapy has recently revolutionized the treatment of several malignancies. While these patients have a durable response to immunotherapy and benefit from improved survival, many solid tumors and in particular, pancreatic cancer, do not respond to standard immunotherapy. They do not elicit a significant immune response and are considered immunologically \u201ccold\u201d tumors. A dense tumor microenvironment is a physical barrier against treatment delivery. It also suppresses the immune system to fight against cancer. Therefore, a multi-modality approach targeting tumor cells and tumor microenvironment can overcome treatment resistance more effectively. Converting \u201ccold\u201d tumors to \u201chot\u201d tumors is an area of great interest in immuno-oncology research. Oncolytic viruses are one of the desirable platforms for this purpose. Their anti-cancer activity is not only the direct killing of tumor cells but also modulating the immune response against cancer. In this project, we have designed novel oncolytic viruses, on a vesicular stomatitis virus backbone, that are bioengineered to express enzymes that target the stroma and tumor microenvironment. In addition, they express antibodies against the immune checkpoint LAG-3. Immune checkpoints inhibit immune response against tumors and by blocking them, they can prevent tumor evasion from the immune system. The combination of LAG-3 inhibition with conventional immune checkpoint inhibitors (PD-1 inhibitors) has been recently shown to enhance immunotherapy efficacy and reverse resistance to PD-1 inhibitors. We hypothesize that this multi-target design offers a comprehensive approach against important resistance mechanisms in pancreatic cancer and not only offers an effective immunotherapeutic approach but also improves the response to available conventional therapies. This study aims to investigate whether targeting the extracellular matrix with the oncolytic virus platform improves anti-tumor toxicity. It determines whether dual targeting of the tumor microenvironment and immune checkpoint inhibition with this oncolytic virus elicits an enhanced immune response. Finally, we will investigate whether combining this novel oncolytic virus with PD-1 inhibitors and standard chemotherapy can elicit safe and effective tumor toxicity and enhanced immune response and if the approach can convert the \u201ccold\u201d tumors to \u201chot\u201d tumors. Validating our hypothesis in preclinical models provides the required evidence for designing clinical trials that investigate the treatment efficacy and safety of this approach in pancreatic cancer patients. Establishing a successful immunotherapeutic approach can revolutionize the treatment of pancreatic cancer.",

      "abstract_text": "Despite the progress in the fight against HIV/AIDS, women around the world remain disproportionately\naffected by HIV. More than half of the HIV cases globally are women, and young women are as twice as\nlikely as young men to acquire HIV. Biological factors have all been suggested to increase women\u2019s risk to\nHIV, and are compounded by social factors such as stigma, social norms, and barriers to accessing sexual\nand reproductive health services. Consequently, women living with HIV (WLWH) experience mental health\nillnesses like stress, depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress symptoms at higher rates than their male\ncounterparts and more often than HIV-unaffected women. These mental health issues affect not only the\nwell-being and quality of life of WLWH but have implications for HIV management and transmission\nprevention. While mental illnesses have significant impact on management of HIV disease, data on the\nburden of mental illnesses and their impact in SSA where most of the PLHIV are residing is lacking. The lack\nof well-trained HIV researchers in mental health and women\u2019s health has also contributed to the low\nunderstanding of comorbidities affecting WLWH in SSA. Therefore, there is a need to build research capacity\nin HIV and mental health particularly among WLWH by investigating the impact of depression on health of\nWLWH in SSA countries like Tanzania, where HIV prevalence is still high at 4.4% in the general population\nbut higher in women at 5.6%. The ongoing Tanzania AIDS Malignancies Research and Training Program\nD43 (TW012277) provides a unique opportunity to train young investigators in the field of HIV-associated\nmalignancy research to address some of the challenges highlighted. We are proposing to mentor a junior\nfemale faculty oncologist who can lead a study in establishing the burden and impact of depression on health\nof WLWH in the country. We hypothesize that WLWH, especially those diagnosed with cancers, will have\nhigh rates of depression, and this condition will negatively influence their ability to control HIV disease. To\ntest this hypothesis, the team will: a) enroll women (HIV+/HIV-, and cancer+/cancer-) at Ocean Road Cancer\nInstitute in Tanzania and establish the burden of depression among WLWH by using a validated depression\nassessment tool, PHQ-9. Information on ART use and its adherence, CD4 counts, HIV viral load, and HIV\ndisease stage will also be systematically documented; b) assess the impact of depression on health of WLWH\nby analyzing severity of depression and how it affects outcomes of WLWH in terms of ART adherence, HIV\nplasma viral load suppression, and HIV disease stage. The proposed study will provide a unique opportunity\nfor a new investigator (Dr. Queen) to acquire new skills in HIV, mental health, and women\u2019s health research\nas a stepping-stone to embark on HIV/AIDS research career and improve research capacity in Tanzania.\nThe generated mental health and outcomes data will be important preliminary data for future research and\ncrucial in designing future strategies to improve health outcomes for WLWH in SSA and beyond.",

      "phr_text": "NARRATIVE\nDespite the progress in the fight against HIV/AIDS for over the last 40 years, women around the world\nremain disproportionately affected by HIV, especially in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) where women living with\nHIV (WLWH) experience mental health illnesses like stress, depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress\nsymptoms at higher rates than their male counterparts and more often than HIV-unaffected women. The\noverall objective of this supplement is to mentor and support a recently graduated female oncologist, Dr.\nQueen Tarimo and bridge her into HIV, mental health, and women\u2019s health research, to characterize\nseverity of depression and its impact on WLWH and how this condition affects their health outcomes. The\nproposed study is significant as it provides a unique opportunity for a new investigator to acquire new\nresearch skills in HIV, mental health, and women\u2019s health as a stepping-stone to embark on HIV/AIDS\nresearch career, and the generated preliminary data will be important for future research and crucial in\ndesigning strategies to improve health outcomes for WLWH in SSA and beyond.",

      "abstract_text": "Abstract\nThis NRSA F30 fellowship will provide the groundwork that will prepare the applicant for a career\nin academic medicine as a cardiothoracic anesthesiologist. Much of the applicant\u2019s career\ndevelopment will come from work in alcohol and cardiovascular-related research. Alcohol-related\nCardiomyopathy (AC) manifests in humans after excessive alcohol consumption and is\ncharacterized by ventricular dilation and cardiac function impairment. During cardiac inflammation\nand injury, fibroblasts differentiate into myofibroblasts, which are larger in cell size and express\nhigher levels of collagens and their crosslinking enzyme lysyl oxidase (LOX). Here, the role of\nTRAF3IP2, a proinflammatory cytoplasmic adapter protein, in the pathogenesis of AC is explored.\nPreliminary data indicates that exposure of na\u00efve cardiac fibroblasts (CF) to alcohol induces\nTRAF3IP2 protein expression in a time- and dose-dependent manner. In our studies, we will\ninvestigate whether i) alcohol-induced cardiac fibroblast activation, and proinflammatory cytokine\nand extracellular matrix expression are dependent on TRAF3IP2 and ii) global TRAF3IP2 gene\ndeletion prevents alcohol-induced cardiac inflammation, fibrosis, and dysfunction.\nThe cellular mechanism underlying alcohol-induced cardiac inflammation and fibrosis are\ninvestigated using both in vitro and in vivo alcohol exposure. In vitro, TRAF3IP2 is targeted using\nna\u00efve CF from wild-type mice transduced with TRAF3IP2 shRNA and CF isolated from\nhomozygous TRAF3IP2 knockout mice. In vivo, TRAF3IP2 is targeted using global TRAF3IP2-\nknockout mice on a 30-day Lieber-DeCarli or isocaloric control liquid diet based on the\nchronic+binge model. Endpoint measures include induction of proinflammatory and profibrotic\npathways.\nUsing the chronic+binge model of AC, TRAF3IP2-KO and littermate controls are exposed to\nchronic alcohol consumption. Endpoints include assessment of cardiac function and chamber\ndimensions by echocardiography and pressure-volume left ventricular catheterization. Markers of\ninflammation and fibrotic measures include collagens I and III, LOX expression, left ventricle total\ncollagen, and histological assessment of interstitial fibrosis by PSR staining.\nUltimately, these studies may identify novel, therapeutic targets for the treatment of alcohol-\nrelated cardiomyopathy. With the support of a strong mentoring team, completion of the proposed\nresearch and training plan will ensure that the applicant is prepared for an impactful career as a\nphysician-scientist.",

      "abstract_text": "Abstract\nAlcohol use disorder (AUD) affects more than 10% of the United States population. AUD is a psychiatric\ndisorder characterized by escalated alcohol drinking and the emergence of profound negative affective states,\nincluding persistent pain. Alcohol is also known for its analgesic effects, although excessive use facilitates pain\nsensitivity (or hyperalgesia) during withdrawal. While chronic pain affects over 20% of the global population\nand contributes to the development and severity of both psychiatric illness and AUD, effective pharmacological\ntreatments for these conditions remain very limited. In recent years, many people have turned to cannabis for\nmanagement of chronic pain and various negative emotional symptoms associated with mental illness.\nHowever, there is a significant gap in knowledge regarding the analgesic efficacy of primary cannabis\nconstituents in the context of alcohol dependence and how use may either mitigate or worsen the risk of\nsubstance use disorders. Specifically, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive component\nof cannabis, may offer a promising avenue for pain management, a common cause of excessive drinking in\nindividuals with AUD. From a neurobiological perspective, the extended amygdala (EA) plays an important role\nin stress- and pain-related components of AUD and is a site where the endocannabinoid (eCB) system\nappears critical for modulating the reinforcing effects of ethanol and transition to dependence. Our previous\npreclinical work has shown a functional role for the central amygdala (CeA), a constituent of the EA, as a key\nbrain region underlying hyperalgesia and escalation of alcohol drinking in alcohol-dependent animal models.\nOur preliminary data indicate an eCB system dysregulation generated by chronic alcohol exposure, which may\npromote the use of alcohol and imply the therapeutic efficacy of cannabis/THC in individuals suffering from\nAUD and AUD-related hyperalgesia. The main research objective of the current proposal is to investigate the\nintricate interplay between the endocannabinoid system, pain, and alcohol use. The studies outlined in this F30\ntraining proposal incorporate both animal modeling and clinical investigation to examine the predictions that: 1)\ndelta-9-THC administration alleviates hyperalgesia and reduces escalated alcohol self-administration in\nalcohol-dependent male and female rats, and 2) increased cannabis use is associated with overall reductions\nin pain symptoms and at-risk alcohol use in men and women. This proposal will provide a promising future\nphysician-scientist with vital research training to become an independent scientist in the field of alcohol and\nclinical neuroscience research.",

      "abstract_text": "PP2A B\u2019 subunit regulates synaptic development and cognition \u2014 learning from human\nmutations\nAbstract\nIntellectual disability (ID) is a severe neurological condition affecting up to 3% of the general\npopulation. There is currently no pharmacological treatment for ID patients. Gene-association\nstudies in ID patients identified an increasing number of genes. However, a vast gap persists\nbetween gene discovery and treatment due to our poor understanding of the molecular\nmechanisms linking cognition and genes. Two ID-linked genes are PPP2R5C and PPP2R5D,\nboth encoding brain-enriched B56 regulatory subunits of the PP2A phosphatase complex.\nHowever, it is unclear how the ID-linked mutations in PPP2R5C or PPP2R5D affect the B56\nsubunit action and subsequent cognitive function. Our studies on wrd, the sole fly orthologue of\nboth PPP2R5C and PPP2R5D, shed light on how these specific subunits of PP2A\nphosphatases regulate synaptic development, neural-activity-driven synaptic structural\nremodeling, learning and memory. We found that Wrd-PP2A mediates dephosphorylation\nevents crucial for structural plasticity at the nerve terminals. Loss of wrd function destabilizes\nactive zones at the larval glutamatergic neuromuscular junctions, diminishes light-induced\nremodeling of active zones at the photoreceptor synapses, and impairs gustatory learning in the\nadult stage. Transiently expressing Wrd protein in adulthood restores the gustatory learning\ndefect in the wrd null mutant flies. These findings together suggest an exciting potential for\nboosting Wrd-PP2A activity (or inhibiting antagonizing kinases of Wrd-PP2A) as a treatment for\nID. In this grant, we propose to generate and study fly Wrd transgenes that mimic the ID-linked\nmutations in human patients. Our study will establish a fly model to dissect the molecular\nmechanisms underlying the root causes of B56-dependent cognitive dysfunctions, paving the\nroad for future therapeutic approaches in treating B56-linked and other forms of ID.",

      "abstract_text": "Abstract Alcohol-mediated mitochondrial adaptations in skeletal muscle: role of Sirtuin1\nThe goal of this Ruth L.\nKirschstein\nNRSA F32 application is to prepare the applicant for an academic career as\nan alcohol researcher. The applicant will have the invaluable opportunity to be trained in alcohol research, and\ntransition from basic science research to translational research. Alcohol-induced skeletal muscle dysfunction\naffects 50% of individuals with alcohol use disorder. Skeletal muscle mitochondrial dysfunction is a salient\nmechanism contributing to myopathy and data from the laboratory demonstrates that alcohol increases reactive\noxygen species production and reduces mitochondrial membrane potential in primary skeletal muscle myoblasts.\nHowever, the alcohol-mediated specific mechanisms leading to impaired bioenergetic capacity and disrupted\ncellular redox homeostasis in skeletal muscle remain incompletely understood. Sirtuin-1 (SIRT1), a NAD+-\ndependent class-III protein deacetylase, regulates mitochondrial dynamics, biogenesis, and bioenergetic\ncapacity. The inhibition of SIRT1 is correlated with increased mitochondrial fission, and exercise-induced\nincreases in NAD+ levels increase skeletal muscle SIRT1 activity, positively influencing energy metabolism. We\npostulate that these alterations arise from increased mitochondrial fission, driven by decreased Sirt1 activity.\nPreliminary data generated for this application indicate that in differentiated primary human myotubes, electrical\npulse stimulation increases ethanol-induced reductions in Sirt1 activity. However, the precise mechanisms by\nwhich Sirt1-induced deacetylation impacts mitochondrial dynamics and contributes to alcohol-mediated\ndysregulated skeletal muscle bioenergetics remain incompletely understood. Taken together, preliminary data\nand published literature provide evidence of alcohol-mediated mitochondrial adaptations leading to skeletal\nmuscle dysfunction. We hypothesize that alcohol dysregulates mitochondrial bioenergetics in myotubes derived\nfrom humans by increasing mitochondrial fission and reducing mitochondrial respiration, in a Sirt1 dependent\nmanner. Additionally, we propose to explore the potential of electrical pulse stimulation to identify the alcohol-\nassociated mitochondrial dysfunction mechanisms that can be positively influenced by exercise. With a strong\nmentoring team, including clinician scientists, completion of the proposed training plan in alcohol-related\nresearch will ensure that the applicant is equipped for a successful career in alcohol translational research.",

      "abstract_text": "Abstract\nTraumatic brain injury (TBI) affects millions of otherwise healthy individuals annually. A significant risk factor for\nTBI is alcohol intoxication, with 30-50% of TBI cases in the US attributed to alcohol-intoxication at the time of\ninjury, potentially intensifying cognitive deficits and TBI-related disability, particularly in moderate to severe\ncases. Moreover, following TBI, approximately 25% of TBI patients resume alcohol consumption, which can\nalso contribute to neuropathological outcomes. Several mechanisms can contribute to greater injury in alcohol\nand TBI comorbid conditions. Prior work from our laboratory has shown enhanced neuroinflammation at site of\nTBI in rodents exposed to alcohol, and delayed recovery of neurobehavioral function in TBI followed by alcohol\nexposure. Enhanced neuroinflammation may be the result of mitochondrial components or metabolic\nbyproducts that act as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Alcohol and TBI both alter cellular\nmetabolism, affects mitochondrial function and glutathione availability. The TBI and alcohol associated\ndisruption in brain metabolism, requires metabolic flexibility in energy substrate utilization to maintain adequate\nATP production. This metabolic shift may lead to glutathione depletion and reactive oxygen species\noverproduction, triggering cell death and accentuated neuropathology that can significantly impact recovery\nfrom TBI. Based on these data, we hypothesize that alcohol exacerbates TBI-induced alterations in\nmitochondrial bioenergetics; particularly at the site of injury, leading to increased oxidative stress and cell\ndeath. Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent programmed cell death mechanism, is highly sensitive to mitochondrial\nbioenergetic alterations and is reported in TBI. The research-training plan proposes three specific aims to test\nthe hypothesis that a) alcohol impairs mitochondrial bioenergetics at the site of TBI injury, b) alcohol\naccentuates oxidative stress affecting predominantly astrocytes at the site of TBI, c) and that ferroptosis is a\nsignificant contributor to cell death at the TBI site. The applicant will leverage his background training in\nmitochondrial mechanisms of tissue injury, translating them from cardiac tissue to the brain and from ischemic\ninjury to TBI, with emphasis of the role of alcohol in exacerbating these pathophysiological mechanisms.",

SCMM prides itself on bringing a critical mass of medical\nmycology researchers together from the south central region of the United States to share the\nlatest research being conducted in the various labs, provide opportunities for collaboration, and\npromote the development of junior trainees in participating laboratories. The meeting site rotates\nbetween university-centered locations in the south central region where fungal-centric\nlaboratories are located. Principal Investigators and students/postdocs from ~15 laboratories\nusually attend annually (including laboratories in the host city). In total there are upwards of 20\nlaboratories that have attended one or more of the meetings depending on the location site. A\nstrong and growing critical mass of medical mycologists have supported this meeting and led to\nits longevity and significance over the past 20 years. Although the meeting format has evolved\nover the years, the current format has focused on oral presentations by trainees regarding their\nmost exciting and impactful unpublished data. The small group setting provides a welcoming\nenvironment that has been successful in promoting discussion and constructive feedback for\ntrainees. Hence, the primary objectives of the meeting are to 1) bring regionally-based medical\nmycologists together to share research, initiate collaborations, and provide a venue for trainees\nto present their latest work, and 2) promote the development of young/junior scientists as a\nmentoring tool to facilitate their transition into academic scientists or their chosen career path.\nThe funding request is for trainee travel awards (n=10), costs of the venue, and to partially\ncover travel costs for the keynote speaker.",

      "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nAfrican Americans have both the highest incidence and mortality of lung cancer compared to any\nother racial/ethnic group. A possible explanation for this disparity is that African Americans (AA)\nmay be less likely to utilize preventative screenings such as Low-dose computed tomography\n(LDCT), which has the potential to encourage smokers to quit smoking successfully. In 2021, the\nUSPSTF expanded their lung cancer screening (LCS) recommendations to include individuals\nages 50-80 years with at least a 20 pack-year history, increasing the number of eligible U.S.\nadults. While the expanded criteria are expected to increase the number of high-risk individuals\neligible for screening and reduce lung cancer mortality, the impact on racial and ethnic minorities,\nincluding African Americans, has shown mixed findings. This is problematic as previous research\nhas found that African Americans may have different quit behaviors than whites. While use of\nLCS as a teachable moment for tobacco cessation is important, currently, there is no well-\nintegrated, comprehensive, culturally relevant community-engaged, sustainable program. Still, it\nis not clear whether the synergy effect of smoking cessation and LDCT LCS intervention was\nobserved in both quitting behaviors and LDCT uptake among African-American smokers. To\naddress this urgent public health concern, this study aims to reduce disparities and the burden of\nlung cancer among AA smokers by supporting a Multiple-level intervention integrating lung cancer\nscreening and smoking cessation(MILS), followed the NIH DEIA strategies using multilevel\ninterventions that impact determinants of health and address health disparities at appropriate time\npoints across the life course. Aim 1) Investigate smokers' and providers' attitudes, knowledge,\nand experiences with the expanded 2021 USPSTF LCS recommendations. Aim 2) Compare the\neffectiveness of a MILS vs. usual care on the biochemically-validated 7-day point-prevalence\ntobacco abstinence rates, LDCT uptake, nicotine dependence and stage of change was\nassessed. Aim 3) Explore barriers and facilitators that influence primary outcomes at the\ncommunity, provider, and individual levels for the improvement of a multilevel intervention. To\ndate, no study has evaluated the synergy effect of smoking cessation intervention and LDCT LCS\nin AA populations with multilevel strategies. We will move the field forward by providing effective,\nscalable interventions to improve both smoking cessation and LDCT lung cancer screening\nadherence to reduce health disparities promised by large clinical trials that motivated screening\nguidelines. The results of the study will directly guide the development of targeted strategies to\nimprove lung cancer screening rates among minorities.",

      "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT\nPeople living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (PLWH) remain at increased risk of developing\nhead and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC) due to oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, despite\nadequate management of HIV with effective antiretroviral therapy (ART). Clinical observations have indicated\nincreased risk of oral HPV infection and pathology in PLWH after they begin taking ART and concurrent with a\nsignificant drop in HIV viral burden. Prior in vitro studies using 3D experimental tissue models that mimic stratified\nsquamous epithelium have suggested that exposure of the tissue to ART agents disrupts the structural integrity\nof the tissue and enhances susceptibility to HPV infection. These findings have not been corroborated in clinical\nstudies using relevant oral mucosal samples from PLWH. We hypothesize that ART damages the integrity of the\noral mucosa and enhances acquisition of HPV infection in vivo. Further, we posit that individuals that are taking\nART for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent HIV infection will exhibit tissue damage and HPV\nsusceptibility similar to that of PLWH who are taking ART to manage their HIV infection. Three specific aims are\nproposed to investigate these hypotheses: 1) to compare the prevalence and incidence of oral HPV infection in\nPLWH taking ART and people taking ART for PrEP to risk-matched HIV seronegative, ART-na\u00efve controls; 2) to\nexamine the architecture of oral mucosal tissue in subjects taking ART/PrEP for evidence of damage to the\nintegrity of the mucosal barrier; and 3) to determine the effect of taking ART/PrEP on tissue susceptibility to HPV\ninfection by experimental challenge of patient oral biopsy-derived 3D tissues with HPV16 in vitro. These studies\nwill, for the first time, discern the role of ART apart from HIV infection on oral mucosa integrity and susceptibility\nto oral HPV infection. This is significant because understanding the interplay between HIV, ART and HPV will\nreveal new opportunities to prevent HNSCC that take into consideration the effects of ART on patient risk.",

      "abstract_text": "Pancreatic cancer is a lethal malignancy. Even with surgical resection, the recurrence rate is high, and chemotherapy is recommended for all patients due to the systemic nature of the disease. A major treatment challenge is the high rate of resistance to the available treatments. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop novel treatment modalities with effective and durable responses. Immunotherapy has recently revolutionized the treatment of several malignancies. While these patients have a durable response to immunotherapy and benefit from improved survival, many solid tumors and in particular, pancreatic cancer, do not respond to standard immunotherapy. They do not elicit a significant immune response and are considered immunologically \u201ccold\u201d tumors. A dense tumor microenvironment is a physical barrier against treatment delivery. It also suppresses the immune system to fight against cancer. Therefore, a multi-modality approach targeting tumor cells and tumor microenvironment can overcome treatment resistance more effectively. Converting \u201ccold\u201d tumors to \u201chot\u201d tumors is an area of great interest in immuno-oncology research. Oncolytic viruses are one of the desirable platforms for this purpose. Their anti-cancer activity is not only the direct killing of tumor cells but also modulating the immune response against cancer. In this project, we have designed novel oncolytic viruses, on a vesicular stomatitis virus backbone, that are bioengineered to express enzymes that target the stroma and tumor microenvironment. In addition, they express antibodies against the immune checkpoint LAG-3. Immune checkpoints inhibit immune response against tumors and by blocking them, they can prevent tumor evasion from the immune system. The combination of LAG-3 inhibition with conventional immune checkpoint inhibitors (PD-1 inhibitors) has been recently shown to enhance immunotherapy efficacy and reverse resistance to PD-1 inhibitors. We hypothesize that this multi-target design offers a comprehensive approach against important resistance mechanisms in pancreatic cancer and not only offers an effective immunotherapeutic approach but also improves the response to available conventional therapies. This study aims to investigate whether targeting the extracellular matrix with the oncolytic virus platform improves anti-tumor toxicity. It determines whether dual targeting of the tumor microenvironment and immune checkpoint inhibition with this oncolytic virus elicits an enhanced immune response. Finally, we will investigate whether combining this novel oncolytic virus with PD-1 inhibitors and standard chemotherapy can elicit safe and effective tumor toxicity and enhanced immune response and if the approach can convert the \u201ccold\u201d tumors to \u201chot\u201d tumors. Validating our hypothesis in preclinical models provides the required evidence for designing clinical trials that investigate the treatment efficacy and safety of this approach in pancreatic cancer patients. Establishing a successful immunotherapeutic approach can revolutionize the treatment of pancreatic cancer.",

More than half of the HIV cases globally are women, and young women are as twice as\nlikely as young men to acquire HIV. Biological factors have all been suggested to increase women\u2019s risk to\nHIV, and are compounded by social factors such as stigma, social norms, and barriers to accessing sexual\nand reproductive health services. Consequently, women living with HIV (WLWH) experience mental health\nillnesses like stress, depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress symptoms at higher rates than their male\ncounterparts and more often than HIV-unaffected women. These mental health issues affect not only the\nwell-being and quality of life of WLWH but have implications for HIV management and transmission\nprevention. While mental illnesses have significant impact on management of HIV disease, data on the\nburden of mental illnesses and their impact in SSA where most of the PLHIV are residing is lacking. The lack\nof well-trained HIV researchers in mental health and women\u2019s health has also contributed to the low\nunderstanding of comorbidities affecting WLWH in SSA. Therefore, there is a need to build research capacity\nin HIV and mental health particularly among WLWH by investigating the impact of depression on health of\nWLWH in SSA countries like Tanzania, where HIV prevalence is still high at 4.4% in the general population\nbut higher in women at 5.6%. The ongoing Tanzania AIDS Malignancies Research and Training Program\nD43 (TW012277) provides a unique opportunity to train young investigators in the field of HIV-associated\nmalignancy research to address some of the challenges highlighted. We are proposing to mentor a junior\nfemale faculty oncologist who can lead a study in establishing the burden and impact of depression on health\nof WLWH in the country. We hypothesize that WLWH, especially those diagnosed with cancers, will have\nhigh rates of depression, and this condition will negatively influence their ability to control HIV disease. To\ntest this hypothesis, the team will: a) enroll women (HIV+/HIV-, and cancer+/cancer-) at Ocean Road Cancer\nInstitute in Tanzania and establish the burden of depression among WLWH by using a validated depression\nassessment tool, PHQ-9. Information on ART use and its adherence, CD4 counts, HIV viral load, and HIV\ndisease stage will also be systematically documented; b) assess the impact of depression on health of WLWH\nby analyzing severity of depression and how it affects outcomes of WLWH in terms of ART adherence, HIV\nplasma viral load suppression, and HIV disease stage. The proposed study will provide a unique opportunity\nfor a new investigator (Dr. Queen) to acquire new skills in HIV, mental health, and women\u2019s health research\nas a stepping-stone to embark on HIV/AIDS research career and improve research capacity in Tanzania.\nThe generated mental health and outcomes data will be important preliminary data for future research and\ncrucial in designing future strategies to improve health outcomes for WLWH in SSA and beyond.",

The\noverall objective of this supplement is to mentor and support a recently graduated female oncologist, Dr.\nQueen Tarimo and bridge her into HIV, mental health, and women\u2019s health research, to characterize\nseverity of depression and its impact on WLWH and how this condition affects their health outcomes.

      "abstract_text": "Abstract\nThis NRSA F30 fellowship will provide the groundwork that will prepare the applicant for a career\nin academic medicine as a cardiothoracic anesthesiologist. Much of the applicant\u2019s career\ndevelopment will come from work in alcohol and cardiovascular-related research. Alcohol-related\nCardiomyopathy (AC) manifests in humans after excessive alcohol consumption and is\ncharacterized by ventricular dilation and cardiac function impairment. During cardiac inflammation\nand injury, fibroblasts differentiate into myofibroblasts, which are larger in cell size and express\nhigher levels of collagens and their crosslinking enzyme lysyl oxidase (LOX). Here, the role of\nTRAF3IP2, a proinflammatory cytoplasmic adapter protein, in the pathogenesis of AC is explored.\nPreliminary data indicates that exposure of na\u00efve cardiac fibroblasts (CF) to alcohol induces\nTRAF3IP2 protein expression in a time- and dose-dependent manner. In our studies, we will\ninvestigate whether i) alcohol-induced cardiac fibroblast activation, and proinflammatory cytokine\nand extracellular matrix expression are dependent on TRAF3IP2 and ii) global TRAF3IP2 gene\ndeletion prevents alcohol-induced cardiac inflammation, fibrosis, and dysfunction.\nThe cellular mechanism underlying alcohol-induced cardiac inflammation and fibrosis are\ninvestigated using both in vitro and in vivo alcohol exposure. In vitro, TRAF3IP2 is targeted using\nna\u00efve CF from wild-type mice transduced with TRAF3IP2 shRNA and CF isolated from\nhomozygous TRAF3IP2 knockout mice. In vivo, TRAF3IP2 is targeted using global TRAF3IP2-\nknockout mice on a 30-day Lieber-DeCarli or isocaloric control liquid diet based on the\nchronic+binge model. Endpoint measures include induction of proinflammatory and profibrotic\npathways.\nUsing the chronic+binge model of AC, TRAF3IP2-KO and littermate controls are exposed to\nchronic alcohol consumption.

      "abstract_text": "Abstract\nAlcohol use disorder (AUD) affects more than 10% of the United States population. AUD is a psychiatric\ndisorder characterized by escalated alcohol drinking and the emergence of profound negative affective states,\nincluding persistent pain. Alcohol is also known for its analgesic effects, although excessive use facilitates pain\nsensitivity (or hyperalgesia) during withdrawal. While chronic pain affects over 20% of the global population\nand contributes to the development and severity of both psychiatric illness and AUD, effective pharmacological\ntreatments for these conditions remain very limited. In recent years, many people have turned to cannabis for\nmanagement of chronic pain and various negative emotional symptoms associated with mental illness.\nHowever, there is a significant gap in knowledge regarding the analgesic efficacy of primary cannabis\nconstituents in the context of alcohol dependence and how use may either mitigate or worsen the risk of\nsubstance use disorders. Specifically, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive component\nof cannabis, may offer a promising avenue for pain management, a common cause of excessive drinking in\nindividuals with AUD. From a neurobiological perspective, the extended amygdala (EA) plays an important role\nin stress- and pain-related components of AUD and is a site where the endocannabinoid (eCB) system\nappears critical for modulating the reinforcing effects of ethanol and transition to dependence. Our previous\npreclinical work has shown a functional role for the central amygdala (CeA), a constituent of the EA, as a key\nbrain region underlying hyperalgesia and escalation of alcohol drinking in alcohol-dependent animal models.\nOur preliminary data indicate an eCB system dysregulation generated by chronic alcohol exposure, which may\npromote the use of alcohol and imply the therapeutic efficacy of cannabis/THC in individuals suffering from\nAUD and AUD-related hyperalgesia. The main research objective of the current proposal is to investigate the\nintricate interplay between the endocannabinoid system, pain, and alcohol use. The studies outlined in this F30\ntraining proposal incorporate both animal modeling and clinical investigation to examine the predictions that: 1)\ndelta-9-THC administration alleviates hyperalgesia and reduces escalated alcohol self-administration in\nalcohol-dependent male and female rats, and 2) increased cannabis use is associated with overall reductions\nin pain symptoms and at-risk alcohol use in men and women. This proposal will provide a promising future\nphysician-scientist with vital research training to become an independent scientist in the field of alcohol and\nclinical neuroscience research.",

      "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nAcute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a heterogeneous syndrome that has multiple etiologies, variable pathogenesis,\nand diverse outcomes. For example, congestive heart failure and dehydration can produce identical changes in\nserum creatinine level and urine output (i.e. parameters used to define AKI); however, they differ vastly in their\nphysiological contexts and demand completely opposite treatments. AKI is common in hospitalized patients,\naffecting 10% to 15% inpatients in the general units and >50% in the intensive care units. Regardless of the\nunderlying cause, even mild forms of AKI are associated with 6.5-fold increase in mortality.\n The current clinical management guideline for AKI is based on minimizing the risk of developing AKI and\nproviding supportive care. However, the sheer number of known and potentially unknown risk factors of AKI\nand the complex interactions among them make it impossible for physicians to analyze and forecast AKI risk\nfor a single patient in real time. Machine learning has demonstrated its success in modeling complex electronic\nhealth record (EHR) data for disease risk predictions, including AKI. Overwhelming majority of the clinical risk\nprediction models are trained on data from a predefined patient cohort, also known as a global prediction\nmodel, optimized for the supposedly \u201caverage\u201d patient. However, the one-size-fits-all prediction model may not\nwork for all patients. Findings from our work in current funding cycle revealed that a global model can make\ncompletely wrong predictions for patients in high-risk and heterogeneous (variable pathogenesis) subgroups\nbecause it only captures knowledge generalizable to a study population but miss subtle risk drivers specific to\nan individual patient.\n Personalized modeling is a promising approach in which a model is trained on-demand for each patient by\nidentifying an individualized retrospective cohort of similar patients. In the current funding cycle, we developed\nand validated a novel personalized AKI prediction framework and demonstrated its ability to capture patient\nheterogeneity with an improved AKI risk prediction for individuals. Building on the success of our current\nproject, in this renewal application, we propose to focus the development of new machine learning methods\nwithin the personalized modeling framework to gain deeper understanding of the personalized AKI risk and its\npredictors from individualized cohorts. We designed three specific aims within the personalized modeling\nframework to answer three important clinical questions: (1) what is an individual patient\u2019s risk for developing\nAKI during hospital stay? (2) why is an individual patient at risk for developing AKI during hospital stay? (3)\nwhen will an individual patient\u2019s kidney function recover after AKI onset? The proposed research has the\npotential to advance personalized decision support, inform personalized intervention, and facilitate shared\ndecision making for providers, AKI patients, and their families.",

      "abstract_text": "Most opioid misuse begins during adolescence and young adulthood. Adolescence is the time to intervene with\nprevention interventions in settings like school-based health centers (HCs), yet few exist that prevent initiation\nof opioid misuse. \u201cSerious videogame\u201d interventions can improve health behaviors. They meet adolescents\n\u201cwhere they are,\u201d and compared to standard interventions, they can reach large populations, with consistent\nfidelity, place limited demands on personnel/resources, facilitate rapid sustainable distribution, all at a\npotentially lower cost. This proposal harnesses the power of videogame interventions and incorporates\ncomponents of effective substance use prevention programs to develop an evidence-informed intervention to\nprevent the initiation of opioid misuse in adolescents. Building on our experience developing videogame\ninterventions and in partnership with the national School-Based Health Alliance (SBHA), we will develop and\ntest a new videogame intervention, PlaySmart. PlaySmart will build upon our PlayForward videogame\nintervention platform that has demonstrated efficacy in improving attitudes and knowledge related to risk\nbehaviors. Through rigorous formative work and with input from adolescents, and our SBHA and game\ndevelopment partners, we will create the PlaySmart videogame intervention. PlaySmart will be designed to\nprovide players with behavioral skills and knowledge through repetitive and engaging videogame play to target\nadolescent perception of risk of harm from initiating opioid misuse. The specific aims of this proposal are to:\n1) Phase 1 (UG3): Develop and pilot-test the PlaySmart game and, working with SBHA stakeholders, develop\nimplementation strategies and partners; and 2) Phase 2 (UH3): Conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT)\nwith 532 high-risk 16-19 year old adolescents, in 10 local school-based (HCs), comparing the PlaySmart game\nto attention/time control games, and work with the SBHA to examine strategies for implementing PlaySmart in\nschool-based HCs nationally. The main outcomes for the RCT will be the proportion of participants who report\na perception of great risk of harm from misuse of opioids, intentions to misuse opioids, self-efficacy for refusing\nopioids, and initiation of opioid misuse. We hypothesize that participants in the PlaySmart group, compared to\nthe control group, will have improved outcomes at 6 weeks (completion of gameplay), and at 3, 6 and 12\nmonths. During the trial, we will collect implementation data from participants and school-based HCs and from\nthe videogame software (e.g. dose). We will use an implementation framework to examine barriers and\nfacilitators to implementing PlaySmart in school-based HCs nationally, and evaluate the cost-effectiveness of\nthe intervention and the cost of the implementation strategies. This research, conducted by an experienced\nteam of videogame intervention researchers and the national SBHA, holds the promise of creating an effective,\nengaging, and tailored intervention for preventing initiation of opioid misuse. This work has considerable\npotential for wide implementation, reach, and impact on high-risk adolescents through school-based HCs.",

      "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY While the recent surge of artificial intelligence (AI) has made remarkable progress in\nvarious image analysis tasks, their performance in a broad range of clinical environment is largely restricted\nby the limited generalization capability when being applied to new data, primarily because most models have\nbeen generated using data from a single institution or public datasets with limited training data. Aggregating\ndata from different institutions could improve model training, but such centralized data sharing is practically\nchallenging due to various technical, legal, privacy and data ownership barriers. This proposal aims to address\nthese barriers by developing a novel gossip federated learning (GFL) framework to build an effective AI model\nby learning from different data sources without the need of sharing patient data. As compared to the traditional\nclient/server federated learning such as FedAvg, the proposed framework is fully decentralized in that the\nmodels trained in local datasets will directly communicate to each other in a peer-to-peer manner, making our\nmethod more robust and efficient. We will develop and evaluate the proposed scheme in the task of automated\norgan segmentation in CT images for liver and head and neck (H&N) cancer patients treated with radiation\ntherapy (RT) because accurate, robust and efficient delineation of those organs at risk (OARs) is a clinically\nimportant but technically challenging problem. We hypothesize that the model trained with our framework can\nachieve segmentation performance not inferior to a model with data pooled from all the resources. The\ndynamics of our recently created healthcare system mimic a diverse multi-institutional environment, which\nplaces us in an ideal setting to systematically evaluate our framework. Our specific aims include: 1) Establish\nthe GFL-based automated OAR segmentation framework, and develop the supporting software infrastructure;\n2) Optimize the GFL-based autosegmentation; 3) Evaluate GFL-based OAR segmentation framework with\n400 liver and 400 H&N cancer patients collected from four hospitals within a metropolitan health system. This\nproposal addresses two key research priorities for NIBIB: machine learning based segmentation and\napproaches that facilitate interoperability among annotations used in image training databases. The success\nof this project will substantially increase the number and variety of data for model training without sacrificing\nthe patient privacy, and thus improve the performance and generalization of the segmentation model on new\ndata. We will open-source this framework, which may enable a larger scale of multi-institutional collaboration\nand could expedite the clinical adoption of AI-driven autosegmentation in RT. More importantly, this framework\nprovides a flexible and robust solution to the primary barrier of applying AI to the medical domain where\nlearning on multi-institutional data sharing is impeded by patient privacy concerns, and is expected to have a\ncatalytic impact on precision medicine by generalizing it to broader applications within medicine where a model\nneeds to learn across multi-institutional data without sacrificing patient privacy.\nProject Summary/Abstract Page 6",

      "abstract_text": "Over 30,000 people per year undergo craniofacial resective surgery and approximately\n15% of the US population suffers from periodontal disease severe enough to warrant surgery\n(Marolt 2015). Currently, craniofacial and periodontal bone tissue engineering faces unique\nchallenges due to the exposure of cranial and periodontal bones to continuous and varying\nloads (Rah 2000). The effect of continuous loads onto the engineered construct necessitates a\ngradual augmentation of an engineered regenerate rather than the en bloc insertion of a\nmechanically inert replacement tissue. In contrast to long bones, which are formed through\nendochondral ossification, cranial vault and periodontal bones are characterized by their unique\nmode of intramembranous ossification, which is accomplished through the stepwise\nmineralization of a specialized extracellular protein matrix rich in collagen and proteoglycans.\nWhen cranial and/or periodontal bones are lost due to trauma or disease, this loss not only\naffects osteoblasts, progenitors, and other bone cells, but also the unique extracellular bone\nmatrix that maintains the instructive signaling environment for continuous bone regeneration\nand replacement. In the present application we have focused on a recently described small\nmolecule mediator, the SETD7 histone lysine methyltransferase inhibitor PFI-2 that in our\npreliminary studies has induced osteoblasts to secrete a typical bone-like extracellular matrix\nenriched in collagen, fibronectin and osteocalcin. In animal studies, PFI-2 has demonstrated\nextraordinary potential to induce bone regeneration, including alveolar bone regeneration over\nhalf of a tooth root\u2019s length and more than 50% new bone coverage of critical size cranial\ndefects. Providing a possible mechanism for these exciting new findings, we have\ndemonstrated that PFI-2 inhibited SETD7 mediated \uf062-catenin methylation, resulting in nuclear\n\uf062-catenin translocation and bone matrix protein transcription activation in addition to the\nstimulation of other processes related to new bone formation, such as cell proliferation and\ndifferentiation. In the present application, we seek to exploit PFI-2\u2019s potential for cranial and\nperiodontal bone regeneration, define the mechanism(s) by which PFI-2 triggers new bone\nextracellular matrix deposition, and engineer scaffolds of sufficient stability to provide a template\nfor PFI-2 nanosphere controlled release toward future applications in clinical use and patient\ncare.",

Here we have developed a novel treatment for bone loss in form of the PFI-2 small molecule\nprobe that promises to repair bone damage and return periodontal tissues to their healthy state.\nApplication of this molecule to grow new bone and cure the diseased gums will greatly benefit patients\nsuffering from bone loss. If we receive support for our application, we will be able to develop this new\ntreatment for gum diseases and help millions of patients who have to see the dentist.

The relocation and expansion of this program will be from CNH Sheikh Zayed campus to the\nnew Children\u2019s National Research and Innovation Campus located at the former Walter Reed Army Medical\nCenter site in Northwest Washington, D.C., 4 miles from the hospital. The project involves\nrenovation/modernization of one floor of the former Armed Forces Institute of Pathology building originally\nconstructed in 1955. The total cost of this construction is estimated to be $9,446,951. This CO6 requests a\nbudget of $8,000,000 with the remainder of the cost (approximately $1,446,951) being funded by CNH. This\nstate-of-the-art core facility will allow the conduct and expansion of genetic and neuroscience research\ninitiatives of the DC-IDDRC, an interdisciplinary and inter-institutional research center. The mission of this\nIDDRC is to improve the understanding and treatment of children with developmental disabilities, including\nautism, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, inherited metabolic disorders and intellectual disability. The new space will\nsupport 3 cores that will be accessible to investigators from the four institutions that comprise the DC-IDDRC:\nCNH, George Washington University (GW), Georgetown University and Howard University. The construction\nwill also include shared hoteling laboratory space for DC-IDDRC investigators whose laboratories are not on-\nsite but who are utilizing the core facility. The proposed DC-IDDRC cores consist of: 1) Cell and Tissue\nMicroscopy, 2) Genomics and Bioinformatics, and 3) Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (IPSC).",

      "abstract_text": "Project Summary / Abstract\nBackground: HIV Translating Initiatives for Depression into Effective Solutions (HITIDES) is a collaborative\ncare intervention that adapts the primary care collaborative care model for depression treatment to HIV clinics.\nIn a randomized controlled trial, HITIDES significantly improved depression symptoms for Veterans Living with\nHIV (VLWH) and delivered cost savings. However, no VHA HIV clinics have implemented HITIDES. The goal\nof this study is to support broad implementation of the HITIDES intervention by testing two appropriate\nimplementation strategies: a clinical champion from each site who, with the help of a learning collaborative of\npeers, will work with local clinicians and leadership to implement the HITIDES intervention at their site with and\nwithout the assistance of external facilitation from an implementation expert.\nSignificance/Impact: Preliminary work has been completed to identify implementation strategies acceptable to\nVLWH and HIV care providers; however, the relative effectiveness and cost of these implementation strategies\nis unknown. While the HITIDES depression care team (DCT) is housed off-site and can deliver services\nconsistently with high quality and fidelity, the ability of the DCT to interface and engage with HIV care providers\nat sites is unknown. Additionally, the mediating effect of site-level implementation outcomes such as reach and\nadoption on effectiveness of the intervention is unknown. Because the DCT can provide services to multiple\nHIV clinics, a small-scale rollout of the intervention is needed before considering a national roll out.\nInnovation: This study employs an innovative hybrid study design to concurrently examine implementation and\neffectiveness outcomes. The use of implementation success as a mediating factor for intervention\neffectiveness is also novel. The relative ability of implementation activities to impact care for vulnerable\npopulations is an area of research where little is known. VHA HIV clinics are an ideal test case for examining\nthese questions because VLWH are a group where racial minority, low income, sexual minority Veterans are\ndisproportionately represented.\nSpecific Aims: 1) Determine, through a cluster-randomized controlled trial among VHA HIV clinics, the effect of\nadding external facilitation to an implementation strategy consisting of a site-level clinical champion and\nlearning collaborative. 2) Determine the impact of HITIDES on changes in depression and suicidal ideation\namong HIV-positive Veterans receiving the intervention. 3) Estimate the budget impact of HITIDES\nimplementation strategies by calculating the costs of each strategy.\nMethodology: The use of a hybrid type-3 effectiveness-implementation trial to examine the interaction of\nimplementation and intervention effectiveness is an innovative methodology ideal for situations where the lack\nof robust evidence of effectiveness is coupled with a cost-saving intervention. This hybrid trial will use a cluster\nrandomization of 8 VHA HIV clinics. These clinics will be chosen for balance and diversity of clinic\ncharacteristics and randomly assigned to one of the two implementation arms. Evaluation of each aim will use\na mix of primary (e.g., QUERI-developed time-tracking tool) and secondary (e.g., clinical data warehouse)\ndata. We expect the clinical champion, learning collaborative, and external facilitation arm to be associated\nwith greater reach and adoption; however, the clinical champion and learning collaborative alone arm is\nexpected to be less costly.\nNext steps: The findings from implementation of the HITIDES intervention to 8 VHA HIV clinics will be used to\ninform selection of implementation strategies for a broad roll out in the future. Findings will be presented in\ncooperation with our operational partner, VA HIV, Hepatitis C, and Related Condition Program to VACO and\nVISN leadership.",

      "phr_text": "PROJECT NARRATIVE\nHIV Translating Initiatives for Depression into Effective Solutions (HITIDES) is a team-based service to\nmanage depression in Veterans Living with HIV (VLWH). This service is more effective for managing\ndepression than the care VLWH usually receive and saves resources. HITIDES is also liked by HIV care\nproviders and VLWH. Despite this, no VA clinics currently offer this service. This study examines two\napproaches to engage clinics with HITIDES, the resulting effects on VLWH, and the costs of these\napproaches. The first approach includes recruiting an HIV care provider at the site to help connect with the\nservice and a network of providers to support this person. The second approach uses an additional external\nexpert to facilitate these connections. Understanding how to connect Veterans to the HITIDES service will\nallow VA to improve depression care for VLWH and save VA resources.",

      "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT\nStromal-derived factor-1 (SDF-1)-based gene therapy that can improve mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) homing\nto the region of myocardial infarct for the treatment of acute myocardial infarction (MI) or chronic heart failure\n(CHF) has shown considerable promise in preclinical and clinical trials. However, the most established\ntechnology requires trans-endocardial injection using a specific device, which can only be handled by an\nexpert. For convenience administration and cost-effective treatment, a targeted systemic delivery strategy has\nto be developed. In this application, a plasmid DNA encoding SDF-1 will be systemically and specifically\ndelivered to the infarct site by the formation of the SDF-1/ischemic myocardium targeting peptide (IMTP)\ncomplex. To generate the SDF-1/IMTP complex, for the first time, we utilize the ligand-to-metal charge transfer\ntransition allowing for direct incorporation of the targeting peptide to the plasmid SDF-1 DNA without the need\nfor any gene carriers. We hypothesized that the LMCT transition between Zn2+ ions and the sulfhydryl group in\ncysteine of the targeting peptide could spontaneously drive the integration of the peptide to the plasmid SDF-1\nthat has already been modified to contain Zn2+ ions. It has been known that divalent metal ions, such as Zn2+,\nlead to the conversion of normal B-DNA to metal-bound DNA (M-DNA) through intercalation into the DNA base\npairs in the pH range of 7.0-8.5. In the preliminary studies, we generated M-DNA using Zn2+ ions, confirmed\nthe formation of the M-DNA/targeting peptide complex through the LMCT transition, and demonstrated that the\nM-DNA/targeting peptide complex led to the enhancement in the gene transfection in the target cells. In this\nproject, in an animal model of CHF, we intend to demonstrate therapeutic efficacy of the targeted systemic\ndelivery of a plasmid SDF-1 DNA by the formation of the SDF-1/IMTP complex generated through the LMCT\ntransition. To achieve the final goal, we intend to demonstrate the followings: 1) direct integration of IMTP into\nthe SDF-1 plasmid through the LMCT transition; 2) targeted transfection of the SDF-1 gene into hypoxic\nprimary cardiomyocytes and the infarct site in the animal model; and 3) facilitated migration of MSCs towards\nthe SDF-1 gradient in the animal model.",

      "abstract_text": "PP2A B\u2019 subunit regulates synaptic development and cognition \u2014 learning from human\nmutations\nAbstract\nIntellectual disability (ID) is a severe neurological condition affecting up to 3% of the general\npopulation. There is currently no pharmacological treatment for ID patients. Gene-association\nstudies in ID patients identified an increasing number of genes. However, a vast gap persists\nbetween gene discovery and treatment due to our poor understanding of the molecular\nmechanisms linking cognition and genes. Two ID-linked genes are PPP2R5C and PPP2R5D,\nboth encoding brain-enriched B56 regulatory subunits of the PP2A phosphatase complex.\nHowever, it is unclear how the ID-linked mutations in PPP2R5C or PPP2R5D affect the B56\nsubunit action and subsequent cognitive function. Our studies on wrd, the sole fly orthologue of\nboth PPP2R5C and PPP2R5D, shed light on how these specific subunits of PP2A\nphosphatases regulate synaptic development, neural-activity-driven synaptic structural\nremodeling, learning and memory. We found that Wrd-PP2A mediates dephosphorylation\nevents crucial for structural plasticity at the nerve terminals. Loss of wrd function destabilizes\nactive zones at the larval glutamatergic neuromuscular junctions, diminishes light-induced\nremodeling of active zones at the photoreceptor synapses, and impairs gustatory learning in the\nadult stage. Transiently expressing Wrd protein in adulthood restores the gustatory learning\ndefect in the wrd null mutant flies. These findings together suggest an exciting potential for\nboosting Wrd-PP2A activity (or inhibiting antagonizing kinases of Wrd-PP2A) as a treatment for\nID. In this grant, we propose to generate and study fly Wrd transgenes that mimic the ID-linked\nmutations in human patients. Our study will establish a fly model to dissect the molecular\nmechanisms underlying the root causes of B56-dependent cognitive dysfunctions, paving the\nroad for future therapeutic approaches in treating B56-linked and other forms of ID.",

      "abstract_text": "Abstract Alcohol-mediated mitochondrial adaptations in skeletal muscle: role of Sirtuin1\nThe goal of this Ruth L.\nKirschstein\nNRSA F32 application is to prepare the applicant for an academic career as\nan alcohol researcher. The applicant will have the invaluable opportunity to be trained in alcohol research, and\ntransition from basic science research to translational research. Alcohol-induced skeletal muscle dysfunction\naffects 50% of individuals with alcohol use disorder. Skeletal muscle mitochondrial dysfunction is a salient\nmechanism contributing to myopathy and data from the laboratory demonstrates that alcohol increases reactive\noxygen species production and reduces mitochondrial membrane potential in primary skeletal muscle myoblasts.\nHowever, the alcohol-mediated specific mechanisms leading to impaired bioenergetic capacity and disrupted\ncellular redox homeostasis in skeletal muscle remain incompletely understood. Sirtuin-1 (SIRT1), a NAD+-\ndependent class-III protein deacetylase, regulates mitochondrial dynamics, biogenesis, and bioenergetic\ncapacity. The inhibition of SIRT1 is correlated with increased mitochondrial fission, and exercise-induced\nincreases in NAD+ levels increase skeletal muscle SIRT1 activity, positively influencing energy metabolism. We\npostulate that these alterations arise from increased mitochondrial fission, driven by decreased Sirt1 activity.\nPreliminary data generated for this application indicate that in differentiated primary human myotubes, electrical\npulse stimulation increases ethanol-induced reductions in Sirt1 activity. However, the precise mechanisms by\nwhich Sirt1-induced deacetylation impacts mitochondrial dynamics and contributes to alcohol-mediated\ndysregulated skeletal muscle bioenergetics remain incompletely understood. Taken together, preliminary data\nand published literature provide evidence of alcohol-mediated mitochondrial adaptations leading to skeletal\nmuscle dysfunction. We hypothesize that alcohol dysregulates mitochondrial bioenergetics in myotubes derived\nfrom humans by increasing mitochondrial fission and reducing mitochondrial respiration, in a Sirt1 dependent\nmanner. Additionally, we propose to explore the potential of electrical pulse stimulation to identify the alcohol-\nassociated mitochondrial dysfunction mechanisms that can be positively influenced by exercise. With a strong\nmentoring team, including clinician scientists, completion of the proposed training plan in alcohol-related\nresearch will ensure that the applicant is equipped for a successful career in alcohol translational research.",

      "abstract_text": "Abstract\nTraumatic brain injury (TBI) affects millions of otherwise healthy individuals annually. A significant risk factor for\nTBI is alcohol intoxication, with 30-50% of TBI cases in the US attributed to alcohol-intoxication at the time of\ninjury, potentially intensifying cognitive deficits and TBI-related disability, particularly in moderate to severe\ncases. Moreover, following TBI, approximately 25% of TBI patients resume alcohol consumption, which can\nalso contribute to neuropathological outcomes. Several mechanisms can contribute to greater injury in alcohol\nand TBI comorbid conditions. Prior work from our laboratory has shown enhanced neuroinflammation at site of\nTBI in rodents exposed to alcohol, and delayed recovery of neurobehavioral function in TBI followed by alcohol\nexposure. Enhanced neuroinflammation may be the result of mitochondrial components or metabolic\nbyproducts that act as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Alcohol and TBI both alter cellular\nmetabolism, affects mitochondrial function and glutathione availability. The TBI and alcohol associated\ndisruption in brain metabolism, requires metabolic flexibility in energy substrate utilization to maintain adequate\nATP production. This metabolic shift may lead to glutathione depletion and reactive oxygen species\noverproduction, triggering cell death and accentuated neuropathology that can significantly impact recovery\nfrom TBI. Based on these data, we hypothesize that alcohol exacerbates TBI-induced alterations in\nmitochondrial bioenergetics; particularly at the site of injury, leading to increased oxidative stress and cell\ndeath. Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent programmed cell death mechanism, is highly sensitive to mitochondrial\nbioenergetic alterations and is reported in TBI. The research-training plan proposes three specific aims to test\nthe hypothesis that a) alcohol impairs mitochondrial bioenergetics at the site of TBI injury, b) alcohol\naccentuates oxidative stress affecting predominantly astrocytes at the site of TBI, c) and that ferroptosis is a\nsignificant contributor to cell death at the TBI site. The applicant will leverage his background training in\nmitochondrial mechanisms of tissue injury, translating them from cardiac tissue to the brain and from ischemic\ninjury to TBI, with emphasis of the role of alcohol in exacerbating these pathophysiological mechanisms.",

      "phr_text": "Narrative\nThis study seeks to elucidate the impact of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) and alcohol exposure on\nmitochondrial metabolism during the recovery phase. Additionally, it investigates the potential of alcohol to\ntrigger ferroptosis, a specific cell death process, through mitochondrial pathways in the context of TBI recovery.\nThe research aims to provide insights into the complex interplay between TBI, alcohol, and mitochondrial\nprocesses, shedding light on potential mechanisms underlying cellular responses during the recovery period.",

      "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nAfrican Americans have both the highest incidence and mortality of lung cancer compared to any\nother racial/ethnic group. A possible explanation for this disparity is that African Americans (AA)\nmay be less likely to utilize preventative screenings such as Low-dose computed tomography\n(LDCT), which has the potential to encourage smokers to quit smoking successfully. In 2021, the\nUSPSTF expanded their lung cancer screening (LCS) recommendations to include individuals\nages 50-80 years with at least a 20 pack-year history, increasing the number of eligible U.S.\nadults. While the expanded criteria are expected to increase the number of high-risk individuals\neligible for screening and reduce lung cancer mortality, the impact on racial and ethnic minorities,\nincluding African Americans, has shown mixed findings. This is problematic as previous research\nhas found that African Americans may have different quit behaviors than whites. While use of\nLCS as a teachable moment for tobacco cessation is important, currently, there is no well-\nintegrated, comprehensive, culturally relevant community-engaged, sustainable program. Still, it\nis not clear whether the synergy effect of smoking cessation and LDCT LCS intervention was\nobserved in both quitting behaviors and LDCT uptake among African-American smokers. To\naddress this urgent public health concern, this study aims to reduce disparities and the burden of\nlung cancer among AA smokers by supporting a Multiple-level intervention integrating lung cancer\nscreening and smoking cessation(MILS), followed the NIH DEIA strategies using multilevel\ninterventions that impact determinants of health and address health disparities at appropriate time\npoints across the life course. Aim 1) Investigate smokers' and providers' attitudes, knowledge,\nand experiences with the expanded 2021 USPSTF LCS recommendations. Aim 2) Compare the\neffectiveness of a MILS vs. usual care on the biochemically-validated 7-day point-prevalence\ntobacco abstinence rates, LDCT uptake, nicotine dependence and stage of change was\nassessed. Aim 3) Explore barriers and facilitators that influence primary outcomes at the\ncommunity, provider, and individual levels for the improvement of a multilevel intervention. To\ndate, no study has evaluated the synergy effect of smoking cessation intervention and LDCT LCS\nin AA populations with multilevel strategies. We will move the field forward by providing effective,\nscalable interventions to improve both smoking cessation and LDCT lung cancer screening\nadherence to reduce health disparities promised by large clinical trials that motivated screening\nguidelines. The results of the study will directly guide the development of targeted strategies to\nimprove lung cancer screening rates among minorities.",

      "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT\nPeople living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (PLWH) remain at increased risk of developing\nhead and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC) due to oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, despite\nadequate management of HIV with effective antiretroviral therapy (ART). Clinical observations have indicated\nincreased risk of oral HPV infection and pathology in PLWH after they begin taking ART and concurrent with a\nsignificant drop in HIV viral burden. Prior in vitro studies using 3D experimental tissue models that mimic stratified\nsquamous epithelium have suggested that exposure of the tissue to ART agents disrupts the structural integrity\nof the tissue and enhances susceptibility to HPV infection. These findings have not been corroborated in clinical\nstudies using relevant oral mucosal samples from PLWH. We hypothesize that ART damages the integrity of the\noral mucosa and enhances acquisition of HPV infection in vivo. Further, we posit that individuals that are taking\nART for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent HIV infection will exhibit tissue damage and HPV\nsusceptibility similar to that of PLWH who are taking ART to manage their HIV infection. Three specific aims are\nproposed to investigate these hypotheses: 1) to compare the prevalence and incidence of oral HPV infection in\nPLWH taking ART and people taking ART for PrEP to risk-matched HIV seronegative, ART-na\u00efve controls; 2) to\nexamine the architecture of oral mucosal tissue in subjects taking ART/PrEP for evidence of damage to the\nintegrity of the mucosal barrier; and 3) to determine the effect of taking ART/PrEP on tissue susceptibility to HPV\ninfection by experimental challenge of patient oral biopsy-derived 3D tissues with HPV16 in vitro. These studies\nwill, for the first time, discern the role of ART apart from HIV infection on oral mucosa integrity and susceptibility\nto oral HPV infection. This is significant because understanding the interplay between HIV, ART and HPV will\nreveal new opportunities to prevent HNSCC that take into consideration the effects of ART on patient risk.",

      "abstract_text": "Pancreatic cancer is a lethal malignancy. Even with surgical resection, the recurrence rate is high, and chemotherapy is recommended for all patients due to the systemic nature of the disease. A major treatment challenge is the high rate of resistance to the available treatments. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop novel treatment modalities with effective and durable responses. Immunotherapy has recently revolutionized the treatment of several malignancies. While these patients have a durable response to immunotherapy and benefit from improved survival, many solid tumors and in particular, pancreatic cancer, do not respond to standard immunotherapy. They do not elicit a significant immune response and are considered immunologically \u201ccold\u201d tumors. A dense tumor microenvironment is a physical barrier against treatment delivery. It also suppresses the immune system to fight against cancer. Therefore, a multi-modality approach targeting tumor cells and tumor microenvironment can overcome treatment resistance more effectively. Converting \u201ccold\u201d tumors to \u201chot\u201d tumors is an area of great interest in immuno-oncology research. Oncolytic viruses are one of the desirable platforms for this purpose. Their anti-cancer activity is not only the direct killing of tumor cells but also modulating the immune response against cancer. In this project, we have designed novel oncolytic viruses, on a vesicular stomatitis virus backbone, that are bioengineered to express enzymes that target the stroma and tumor microenvironment. In addition, they express antibodies against the immune checkpoint LAG-3. Immune checkpoints inhibit immune response against tumors and by blocking them, they can prevent tumor evasion from the immune system. The combination of LAG-3 inhibition with conventional immune checkpoint inhibitors (PD-1 inhibitors) has been recently shown to enhance immunotherapy efficacy and reverse resistance to PD-1 inhibitors. We hypothesize that this multi-target design offers a comprehensive approach against important resistance mechanisms in pancreatic cancer and not only offers an effective immunotherapeutic approach but also improves the response to available conventional therapies. This study aims to investigate whether targeting the extracellular matrix with the oncolytic virus platform improves anti-tumor toxicity. It determines whether dual targeting of the tumor microenvironment and immune checkpoint inhibition with this oncolytic virus elicits an enhanced immune response. Finally, we will investigate whether combining this novel oncolytic virus with PD-1 inhibitors and standard chemotherapy can elicit safe and effective tumor toxicity and enhanced immune response and if the approach can convert the \u201ccold\u201d tumors to \u201chot\u201d tumors. Validating our hypothesis in preclinical models provides the required evidence for designing clinical trials that investigate the treatment efficacy and safety of this approach in pancreatic cancer patients. Establishing a successful immunotherapeutic approach can revolutionize the treatment of pancreatic cancer.",

      "abstract_text": "Despite the progress in the fight against HIV/AIDS, women around the world remain disproportionately\naffected by HIV. More than half of the HIV cases globally are women, and young women are as twice as\nlikely as young men to acquire HIV. Biological factors have all been suggested to increase women\u2019s risk to\nHIV, and are compounded by social factors such as stigma, social norms, and barriers to accessing sexual\nand reproductive health services. Consequently, women living with HIV (WLWH) experience mental health\nillnesses like stress, depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress symptoms at higher rates than their male\ncounterparts and more often than HIV-unaffected women. These mental health issues affect not only the\nwell-being and quality of life of WLWH but have implications for HIV management and transmission\nprevention. While mental illnesses have significant impact on management of HIV disease, data on the\nburden of mental illnesses and their impact in SSA where most of the PLHIV are residing is lacking. The lack\nof well-trained HIV researchers in mental health and women\u2019s health has also contributed to the low\nunderstanding of comorbidities affecting WLWH in SSA. Therefore, there is a need to build research capacity\nin HIV and mental health particularly among WLWH by investigating the impact of depression on health of\nWLWH in SSA countries like Tanzania, where HIV prevalence is still high at 4.4% in the general population\nbut higher in women at 5.6%. The ongoing Tanzania AIDS Malignancies Research and Training Program\nD43 (TW012277) provides a unique opportunity to train young investigators in the field of HIV-associated\nmalignancy research to address some of the challenges highlighted. We are proposing to mentor a junior\nfemale faculty oncologist who can lead a study in establishing the burden and impact of depression on health\nof WLWH in the country. We hypothesize that WLWH, especially those diagnosed with cancers, will have\nhigh rates of depression, and this condition will negatively influence their ability to control HIV disease. To\ntest this hypothesis, the team will: a) enroll women (HIV+/HIV-, and cancer+/cancer-) at Ocean Road Cancer\nInstitute in Tanzania and establish the burden of depression among WLWH by using a validated depression\nassessment tool, PHQ-9. Information on ART use and its adherence, CD4 counts, HIV viral load, and HIV\ndisease stage will also be systematically documented; b) assess the impact of depression on health of WLWH\nby analyzing severity of depression and how it affects outcomes of WLWH in terms of ART adherence, HIV\nplasma viral load suppression, and HIV disease stage. The proposed study will provide a unique opportunity\nfor a new investigator (Dr. Queen) to acquire new skills in HIV, mental health, and women\u2019s health research\nas a stepping-stone to embark on HIV/AIDS research career and improve research capacity in Tanzania.\nThe generated mental health and outcomes data will be important preliminary data for future research and\ncrucial in designing future strategies to improve health outcomes for WLWH in SSA and beyond.",

The\noverall objective of this supplement is to mentor and support a recently graduated female oncologist, Dr.\nQueen Tarimo and bridge her into HIV, mental health, and women\u2019s health research, to characterize\nseverity of depression and its impact on WLWH and how this condition affects their health outcomes.

      "abstract_text": "Abstract\nThis NRSA F30 fellowship will provide the groundwork that will prepare the applicant for a career\nin academic medicine as a cardiothoracic anesthesiologist. Much of the applicant\u2019s career\ndevelopment will come from work in alcohol and cardiovascular-related research. Alcohol-related\nCardiomyopathy (AC) manifests in humans after excessive alcohol consumption and is\ncharacterized by ventricular dilation and cardiac function impairment. During cardiac inflammation\nand injury, fibroblasts differentiate into myofibroblasts, which are larger in cell size and express\nhigher levels of collagens and their crosslinking enzyme lysyl oxidase (LOX). Here, the role of\nTRAF3IP2, a proinflammatory cytoplasmic adapter protein, in the pathogenesis of AC is explored.\nPreliminary data indicates that exposure of na\u00efve cardiac fibroblasts (CF) to alcohol induces\nTRAF3IP2 protein expression in a time- and dose-dependent manner. In our studies, we will\ninvestigate whether i) alcohol-induced cardiac fibroblast activation, and proinflammatory cytokine\nand extracellular matrix expression are dependent on TRAF3IP2 and ii) global TRAF3IP2 gene\ndeletion prevents alcohol-induced cardiac inflammation, fibrosis, and dysfunction.\nThe cellular mechanism underlying alcohol-induced cardiac inflammation and fibrosis are\ninvestigated using both in vitro and in vivo alcohol exposure. In vitro, TRAF3IP2 is targeted using\nna\u00efve CF from wild-type mice transduced with TRAF3IP2 shRNA and CF isolated from\nhomozygous TRAF3IP2 knockout mice. In vivo, TRAF3IP2 is targeted using global TRAF3IP2-\nknockout mice on a 30-day Lieber-DeCarli or isocaloric control liquid diet based on the\nchronic+binge model. Endpoint measures include induction of proinflammatory and profibrotic\npathways.\nUsing the chronic+binge model of AC, TRAF3IP2-KO and littermate controls are exposed to\nchronic alcohol consumption. Endpoints include assessment of cardiac function and chamber\ndimensions by echocardiography and pressure-volume left ventricular catheterization. Markers of\ninflammation and fibrotic measures include collagens I and III, LOX expression, left ventricle total\ncollagen, and histological assessment of interstitial fibrosis by PSR staining.\nUltimately, these studies may identify novel, therapeutic targets for the treatment of alcohol-\nrelated cardiomyopathy. With the support of a strong mentoring team, completion of the proposed\nresearch and training plan will ensure that the applicant is prepared for an impactful career as a\nphysician-scientist.",

      "abstract_text": "Abstract\nAlcohol use disorder (AUD) affects more than 10% of the United States population. AUD is a psychiatric\ndisorder characterized by escalated alcohol drinking and the emergence of profound negative affective states,\nincluding persistent pain. Alcohol is also known for its analgesic effects, although excessive use facilitates pain\nsensitivity (or hyperalgesia) during withdrawal. While chronic pain affects over 20% of the global population\nand contributes to the development and severity of both psychiatric illness and AUD, effective pharmacological\ntreatments for these conditions remain very limited. In recent years, many people have turned to cannabis for\nmanagement of chronic pain and various negative emotional symptoms associated with mental illness.\nHowever, there is a significant gap in knowledge regarding the analgesic efficacy of primary cannabis\nconstituents in the context of alcohol dependence and how use may either mitigate or worsen the risk of\nsubstance use disorders. Specifically, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive component\nof cannabis, may offer a promising avenue for pain management, a common cause of excessive drinking in\nindividuals with AUD. From a neurobiological perspective, the extended amygdala (EA) plays an important role\nin stress- and pain-related components of AUD and is a site where the endocannabinoid (eCB) system\nappears critical for modulating the reinforcing effects of ethanol and transition to dependence. Our previous\npreclinical work has shown a functional role for the central amygdala (CeA), a constituent of the EA, as a key\nbrain region underlying hyperalgesia and escalation of alcohol drinking in alcohol-dependent animal models.\nOur preliminary data indicate an eCB system dysregulation generated by chronic alcohol exposure, which may\npromote the use of alcohol and imply the therapeutic efficacy of cannabis/THC in individuals suffering from\nAUD and AUD-related hyperalgesia. The main research objective of the current proposal is to investigate the\nintricate interplay between the endocannabinoid system, pain, and alcohol use. The studies outlined in this F30\ntraining proposal incorporate both animal modeling and clinical investigation to examine the predictions that: 1)\ndelta-9-THC administration alleviates hyperalgesia and reduces escalated alcohol self-administration in\nalcohol-dependent male and female rats, and 2) increased cannabis use is associated with overall reductions\nin pain symptoms and at-risk alcohol use in men and women. This proposal will provide a promising future\nphysician-scientist with vital research training to become an independent scientist in the field of alcohol and\nclinical neuroscience research.",

      "abstract_text": "PP2A B\u2019 subunit regulates synaptic development and cognition \u2014 learning from human\nmutations\nAbstract\nIntellectual disability (ID) is a severe neurological condition affecting up to 3% of the general\npopulation. There is currently no pharmacological treatment for ID patients. Gene-association\nstudies in ID patients identified an increasing number of genes. However, a vast gap persists\nbetween gene discovery and treatment due to our poor understanding of the molecular\nmechanisms linking cognition and genes. Two ID-linked genes are PPP2R5C and PPP2R5D,\nboth encoding brain-enriched B56 regulatory subunits of the PP2A phosphatase complex.\nHowever, it is unclear how the ID-linked mutations in PPP2R5C or PPP2R5D affect the B56\nsubunit action and subsequent cognitive function. Our studies on wrd, the sole fly orthologue of\nboth PPP2R5C and PPP2R5D, shed light on how these specific subunits of PP2A\nphosphatases regulate synaptic development, neural-activity-driven synaptic structural\nremodeling, learning and memory. We found that Wrd-PP2A mediates dephosphorylation\nevents crucial for structural plasticity at the nerve terminals. Loss of wrd function destabilizes\nactive zones at the larval glutamatergic neuromuscular junctions, diminishes light-induced\nremodeling of active zones at the photoreceptor synapses, and impairs gustatory learning in the\nadult stage. Transiently expressing Wrd protein in adulthood restores the gustatory learning\ndefect in the wrd null mutant flies. These findings together suggest an exciting potential for\nboosting Wrd-PP2A activity (or inhibiting antagonizing kinases of Wrd-PP2A) as a treatment for\nID. In this grant, we propose to generate and study fly Wrd transgenes that mimic the ID-linked\nmutations in human patients. Our study will establish a fly model to dissect the molecular\nmechanisms underlying the root causes of B56-dependent cognitive dysfunctions, paving the\nroad for future therapeutic approaches in treating B56-linked and other forms of ID.",

      "abstract_text": "Abstract Alcohol-mediated mitochondrial adaptations in skeletal muscle: role of Sirtuin1\nThe goal of this Ruth L.\nKirschstein\nNRSA F32 application is to prepare the applicant for an academic career as\nan alcohol researcher. The applicant will have the invaluable opportunity to be trained in alcohol research, and\ntransition from basic science research to translational research. Alcohol-induced skeletal muscle dysfunction\naffects 50% of individuals with alcohol use disorder. Skeletal muscle mitochondrial dysfunction is a salient\nmechanism contributing to myopathy and data from the laboratory demonstrates that alcohol increases reactive\noxygen species production and reduces mitochondrial membrane potential in primary skeletal muscle myoblasts.\nHowever, the alcohol-mediated specific mechanisms leading to impaired bioenergetic capacity and disrupted\ncellular redox homeostasis in skeletal muscle remain incompletely understood. Sirtuin-1 (SIRT1), a NAD+-\ndependent class-III protein deacetylase, regulates mitochondrial dynamics, biogenesis, and bioenergetic\ncapacity. The inhibition of SIRT1 is correlated with increased mitochondrial fission, and exercise-induced\nincreases in NAD+ levels increase skeletal muscle SIRT1 activity, positively influencing energy metabolism. We\npostulate that these alterations arise from increased mitochondrial fission, driven by decreased Sirt1 activity.\nPreliminary data generated for this application indicate that in differentiated primary human myotubes, electrical\npulse stimulation increases ethanol-induced reductions in Sirt1 activity. However, the precise mechanisms by\nwhich Sirt1-induced deacetylation impacts mitochondrial dynamics and contributes to alcohol-mediated\ndysregulated skeletal muscle bioenergetics remain incompletely understood. Taken together, preliminary data\nand published literature provide evidence of alcohol-mediated mitochondrial adaptations leading to skeletal\nmuscle dysfunction. We hypothesize that alcohol dysregulates mitochondrial bioenergetics in myotubes derived\nfrom humans by increasing mitochondrial fission and reducing mitochondrial respiration, in a Sirt1 dependent\nmanner. Additionally, we propose to explore the potential of electrical pulse stimulation to identify the alcohol-\nassociated mitochondrial dysfunction mechanisms that can be positively influenced by exercise. With a strong\nmentoring team, including clinician scientists, completion of the proposed training plan in alcohol-related\nresearch will ensure that the applicant is equipped for a successful career in alcohol translational research.",

      "abstract_text": "Abstract\nTraumatic brain injury (TBI) affects millions of otherwise healthy individuals annually. A significant risk factor for\nTBI is alcohol intoxication, with 30-50% of TBI cases in the US attributed to alcohol-intoxication at the time of\ninjury, potentially intensifying cognitive deficits and TBI-related disability, particularly in moderate to severe\ncases. Moreover, following TBI, approximately 25% of TBI patients resume alcohol consumption, which can\nalso contribute to neuropathological outcomes. Several mechanisms can contribute to greater injury in alcohol\nand TBI comorbid conditions. Prior work from our laboratory has shown enhanced neuroinflammation at site of\nTBI in rodents exposed to alcohol, and delayed recovery of neurobehavioral function in TBI followed by alcohol\nexposure. Enhanced neuroinflammation may be the result of mitochondrial components or metabolic\nbyproducts that act as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Alcohol and TBI both alter cellular\nmetabolism, affects mitochondrial function and glutathione availability. The TBI and alcohol associated\ndisruption in brain metabolism, requires metabolic flexibility in energy substrate utilization to maintain adequate\nATP production. This metabolic shift may lead to glutathione depletion and reactive oxygen species\noverproduction, triggering cell death and accentuated neuropathology that can significantly impact recovery\nfrom TBI. Based on these data, we hypothesize that alcohol exacerbates TBI-induced alterations in\nmitochondrial bioenergetics; particularly at the site of injury, leading to increased oxidative stress and cell\ndeath. Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent programmed cell death mechanism, is highly sensitive to mitochondrial\nbioenergetic alterations and is reported in TBI. The research-training plan proposes three specific aims to test\nthe hypothesis that a) alcohol impairs mitochondrial bioenergetics at the site of TBI injury, b) alcohol\naccentuates oxidative stress affecting predominantly astrocytes at the site of TBI, c) and that ferroptosis is a\nsignificant contributor to cell death at the TBI site. The applicant will leverage his background training in\nmitochondrial mechanisms of tissue injury, translating them from cardiac tissue to the brain and from ischemic\ninjury to TBI, with emphasis of the role of alcohol in exacerbating these pathophysiological mechanisms.",

SCMM prides itself on bringing a critical mass of medical\nmycology researchers together from the south central region of the United States to share the\nlatest research being conducted in the various labs, provide opportunities for collaboration, and\npromote the development of junior trainees in participating laboratories. The meeting site rotates\nbetween university-centered locations in the south central region where fungal-centric\nlaboratories are located. Principal Investigators and students/postdocs from ~15 laboratories\nusually attend annually (including laboratories in the host city). In total there are upwards of 20\nlaboratories that have attended one or more of the meetings depending on the location site. A\nstrong and growing critical mass of medical mycologists have supported this meeting and led to\nits longevity and significance over the past 20 years. Although the meeting format has evolved\nover the years, the current format has focused on oral presentations by trainees regarding their\nmost exciting and impactful unpublished data. The small group setting provides a welcoming\nenvironment that has been successful in promoting discussion and constructive feedback for\ntrainees. Hence, the primary objectives of the meeting are to 1) bring regionally-based medical\nmycologists together to share research, initiate collaborations, and provide a venue for trainees\nto present their latest work, and 2) promote the development of young/junior scientists as a\nmentoring tool to facilitate their transition into academic scientists or their chosen career path.\nThe funding request is for trainee travel awards (n=10), costs of the venue, and to partially\ncover travel costs for the keynote speaker.",

      "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nAfrican Americans have both the highest incidence and mortality of lung cancer compared to any\nother racial/ethnic group. A possible explanation for this disparity is that African Americans (AA)\nmay be less likely to utilize preventative screenings such as Low-dose computed tomography\n(LDCT), which has the potential to encourage smokers to quit smoking successfully. In 2021, the\nUSPSTF expanded their lung cancer screening (LCS) recommendations to include individuals\nages 50-80 years with at least a 20 pack-year history, increasing the number of eligible U.S.\nadults. While the expanded criteria are expected to increase the number of high-risk individuals\neligible for screening and reduce lung cancer mortality, the impact on racial and ethnic minorities,\nincluding African Americans, has shown mixed findings. This is problematic as previous research\nhas found that African Americans may have different quit behaviors than whites. While use of\nLCS as a teachable moment for tobacco cessation is important, currently, there is no well-\nintegrated, comprehensive, culturally relevant community-engaged, sustainable program. Still, it\nis not clear whether the synergy effect of smoking cessation and LDCT LCS intervention was\nobserved in both quitting behaviors and LDCT uptake among African-American smokers. To\naddress this urgent public health concern, this study aims to reduce disparities and the burden of\nlung cancer among AA smokers by supporting a Multiple-level intervention integrating lung cancer\nscreening and smoking cessation(MILS), followed the NIH DEIA strategies using multilevel\ninterventions that impact determinants of health and address health disparities at appropriate time\npoints across the life course. Aim 1) Investigate smokers' and providers' attitudes, knowledge,\nand experiences with the expanded 2021 USPSTF LCS recommendations. Aim 2) Compare the\neffectiveness of a MILS vs. usual care on the biochemically-validated 7-day point-prevalence\ntobacco abstinence rates, LDCT uptake, nicotine dependence and stage of change was\nassessed. Aim 3) Explore barriers and facilitators that influence primary outcomes at the\ncommunity, provider, and individual levels for the improvement of a multilevel intervention. To\ndate, no study has evaluated the synergy effect of smoking cessation intervention and LDCT LCS\nin AA populations with multilevel strategies. We will move the field forward by providing effective,\nscalable interventions to improve both smoking cessation and LDCT lung cancer screening\nadherence to reduce health disparities promised by large clinical trials that motivated screening\nguidelines. The results of the study will directly guide the development of targeted strategies to\nimprove lung cancer screening rates among minorities.",

      "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT\nPeople living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (PLWH) remain at increased risk of developing\nhead and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC) due to oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, despite\nadequate management of HIV with effective antiretroviral therapy (ART). Clinical observations have indicated\nincreased risk of oral HPV infection and pathology in PLWH after they begin taking ART and concurrent with a\nsignificant drop in HIV viral burden. Prior in vitro studies using 3D experimental tissue models that mimic stratified\nsquamous epithelium have suggested that exposure of the tissue to ART agents disrupts the structural integrity\nof the tissue and enhances susceptibility to HPV infection. These findings have not been corroborated in clinical\nstudies using relevant oral mucosal samples from PLWH. We hypothesize that ART damages the integrity of the\noral mucosa and enhances acquisition of HPV infection in vivo. Further, we posit that individuals that are taking\nART for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent HIV infection will exhibit tissue damage and HPV\nsusceptibility similar to that of PLWH who are taking ART to manage their HIV infection. Three specific aims are\nproposed to investigate these hypotheses: 1) to compare the prevalence and incidence of oral HPV infection in\nPLWH taking ART and people taking ART for PrEP to risk-matched HIV seronegative, ART-na\u00efve controls; 2) to\nexamine the architecture of oral mucosal tissue in subjects taking ART/PrEP for evidence of damage to the\nintegrity of the mucosal barrier; and 3) to determine the effect of taking ART/PrEP on tissue susceptibility to HPV\ninfection by experimental challenge of patient oral biopsy-derived 3D tissues with HPV16 in vitro. These studies\nwill, for the first time, discern the role of ART apart from HIV infection on oral mucosa integrity and susceptibility\nto oral HPV infection. This is significant because understanding the interplay between HIV, ART and HPV will\nreveal new opportunities to prevent HNSCC that take into consideration the effects of ART on patient risk.",

      "abstract_text": "Pancreatic cancer is a lethal malignancy. Even with surgical resection, the recurrence rate is high, and chemotherapy is recommended for all patients due to the systemic nature of the disease. A major treatment challenge is the high rate of resistance to the available treatments. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop novel treatment modalities with effective and durable responses. Immunotherapy has recently revolutionized the treatment of several malignancies. While these patients have a durable response to immunotherapy and benefit from improved survival, many solid tumors and in particular, pancreatic cancer, do not respond to standard immunotherapy. They do not elicit a significant immune response and are considered immunologically \u201ccold\u201d tumors. A dense tumor microenvironment is a physical barrier against treatment delivery. It also suppresses the immune system to fight against cancer. Therefore, a multi-modality approach targeting tumor cells and tumor microenvironment can overcome treatment resistance more effectively. Converting \u201ccold\u201d tumors to \u201chot\u201d tumors is an area of great interest in immuno-oncology research. Oncolytic viruses are one of the desirable platforms for this purpose. Their anti-cancer activity is not only the direct killing of tumor cells but also modulating the immune response against cancer. In this project, we have designed novel oncolytic viruses, on a vesicular stomatitis virus backbone, that are bioengineered to express enzymes that target the stroma and tumor microenvironment. In addition, they express antibodies against the immune checkpoint LAG-3. Immune checkpoints inhibit immune response against tumors and by blocking them, they can prevent tumor evasion from the immune system. The combination of LAG-3 inhibition with conventional immune checkpoint inhibitors (PD-1 inhibitors) has been recently shown to enhance immunotherapy efficacy and reverse resistance to PD-1 inhibitors. We hypothesize that this multi-target design offers a comprehensive approach against important resistance mechanisms in pancreatic cancer and not only offers an effective immunotherapeutic approach but also improves the response to available conventional therapies. This study aims to investigate whether targeting the extracellular matrix with the oncolytic virus platform improves anti-tumor toxicity. It determines whether dual targeting of the tumor microenvironment and immune checkpoint inhibition with this oncolytic virus elicits an enhanced immune response. Finally, we will investigate whether combining this novel oncolytic virus with PD-1 inhibitors and standard chemotherapy can elicit safe and effective tumor toxicity and enhanced immune response and if the approach can convert the \u201ccold\u201d tumors to \u201chot\u201d tumors. Validating our hypothesis in preclinical models provides the required evidence for designing clinical trials that investigate the treatment efficacy and safety of this approach in pancreatic cancer patients. Establishing a successful immunotherapeutic approach can revolutionize the treatment of pancreatic cancer.",

      "abstract_text": "Despite the progress in the fight against HIV/AIDS, women around the world remain disproportionately\naffected by HIV. More than half of the HIV cases globally are women, and young women are as twice as\nlikely as young men to acquire HIV. Biological factors have all been suggested to increase women\u2019s risk to\nHIV, and are compounded by social factors such as stigma, social norms, and barriers to accessing sexual\nand reproductive health services. Consequently, women living with HIV (WLWH) experience mental health\nillnesses like stress, depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress symptoms at higher rates than their male\ncounterparts and more often than HIV-unaffected women. These mental health issues affect not only the\nwell-being and quality of life of WLWH but have implications for HIV management and transmission\nprevention. While mental illnesses have significant impact on management of HIV disease, data on the\nburden of mental illnesses and their impact in SSA where most of the PLHIV are residing is lacking. The lack\nof well-trained HIV researchers in mental health and women\u2019s health has also contributed to the low\nunderstanding of comorbidities affecting WLWH in SSA. Therefore, there is a need to build research capacity\nin HIV and mental health particularly among WLWH by investigating the impact of depression on health of\nWLWH in SSA countries like Tanzania, where HIV prevalence is still high at 4.4% in the general population\nbut higher in women at 5.6%. The ongoing Tanzania AIDS Malignancies Research and Training Program\nD43 (TW012277) provides a unique opportunity to train young investigators in the field of HIV-associated\nmalignancy research to address some of the challenges highlighted. We are proposing to mentor a junior\nfemale faculty oncologist who can lead a study in establishing the burden and impact of depression on health\nof WLWH in the country. We hypothesize that WLWH, especially those diagnosed with cancers, will have\nhigh rates of depression, and this condition will negatively influence their ability to control HIV disease. To\ntest this hypothesis, the team will: a) enroll women (HIV+/HIV-, and cancer+/cancer-) at Ocean Road Cancer\nInstitute in Tanzania and establish the burden of depression among WLWH by using a validated depression\nassessment tool, PHQ-9. Information on ART use and its adherence, CD4 counts, HIV viral load, and HIV\ndisease stage will also be systematically documented; b) assess the impact of depression on health of WLWH\nby analyzing severity of depression and how it affects outcomes of WLWH in terms of ART adherence, HIV\nplasma viral load suppression, and HIV disease stage. The proposed study will provide a unique opportunity\nfor a new investigator (Dr. Queen) to acquire new skills in HIV, mental health, and women\u2019s health research\nas a stepping-stone to embark on HIV/AIDS research career and improve research capacity in Tanzania.\nThe generated mental health and outcomes data will be important preliminary data for future research and\ncrucial in designing future strategies to improve health outcomes for WLWH in SSA and beyond.",

      "phr_text": "NARRATIVE\nDespite the progress in the fight against HIV/AIDS for over the last 40 years, women around the world\nremain disproportionately affected by HIV, especially in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) where women living with\nHIV (WLWH) experience mental health illnesses like stress, depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress\nsymptoms at higher rates than their male counterparts and more often than HIV-unaffected women. The\noverall objective of this supplement is to mentor and support a recently graduated female oncologist, Dr.\nQueen Tarimo and bridge her into HIV, mental health, and women\u2019s health research, to characterize\nseverity of depression and its impact on WLWH and how this condition affects their health outcomes. The\nproposed study is significant as it provides a unique opportunity for a new investigator to acquire new\nresearch skills in HIV, mental health, and women\u2019s health as a stepping-stone to embark on HIV/AIDS\nresearch career, and the generated preliminary data will be important for future research and crucial in\ndesigning strategies to improve health outcomes for WLWH in SSA and beyond.",

      "abstract_text": "Abstract\nThis NRSA F30 fellowship will provide the groundwork that will prepare the applicant for a career\nin academic medicine as a cardiothoracic anesthesiologist. Much of the applicant\u2019s career\ndevelopment will come from work in alcohol and cardiovascular-related research. Alcohol-related\nCardiomyopathy (AC) manifests in humans after excessive alcohol consumption and is\ncharacterized by ventricular dilation and cardiac function impairment. During cardiac inflammation\nand injury, fibroblasts differentiate into myofibroblasts, which are larger in cell size and express\nhigher levels of collagens and their crosslinking enzyme lysyl oxidase (LOX). Here, the role of\nTRAF3IP2, a proinflammatory cytoplasmic adapter protein, in the pathogenesis of AC is explored.\nPreliminary data indicates that exposure of na\u00efve cardiac fibroblasts (CF) to alcohol induces\nTRAF3IP2 protein expression in a time- and dose-dependent manner. In our studies, we will\ninvestigate whether i) alcohol-induced cardiac fibroblast activation, and proinflammatory cytokine\nand extracellular matrix expression are dependent on TRAF3IP2 and ii) global TRAF3IP2 gene\ndeletion prevents alcohol-induced cardiac inflammation, fibrosis, and dysfunction.\nThe cellular mechanism underlying alcohol-induced cardiac inflammation and fibrosis are\ninvestigated using both in vitro and in vivo alcohol exposure. In vitro, TRAF3IP2 is targeted using\nna\u00efve CF from wild-type mice transduced with TRAF3IP2 shRNA and CF isolated from\nhomozygous TRAF3IP2 knockout mice. In vivo, TRAF3IP2 is targeted using global TRAF3IP2-\nknockout mice on a 30-day Lieber-DeCarli or isocaloric control liquid diet based on the\nchronic+binge model. Endpoint measures include induction of proinflammatory and profibrotic\npathways.\nUsing the chronic+binge model of AC, TRAF3IP2-KO and littermate controls are exposed to\nchronic alcohol consumption. Endpoints include assessment of cardiac function and chamber\ndimensions by echocardiography and pressure-volume left ventricular catheterization. Markers of\ninflammation and fibrotic measures include collagens I and III, LOX expression, left ventricle total\ncollagen, and histological assessment of interstitial fibrosis by PSR staining.\nUltimately, these studies may identify novel, therapeutic targets for the treatment of alcohol-\nrelated cardiomyopathy. With the support of a strong mentoring team, completion of the proposed\nresearch and training plan will ensure that the applicant is prepared for an impactful career as a\nphysician-scientist.",

      "abstract_text": "Abstract\nAlcohol use disorder (AUD) affects more than 10% of the United States population. AUD is a psychiatric\ndisorder characterized by escalated alcohol drinking and the emergence of profound negative affective states,\nincluding persistent pain. Alcohol is also known for its analgesic effects, although excessive use facilitates pain\nsensitivity (or hyperalgesia) during withdrawal. While chronic pain affects over 20% of the global population\nand contributes to the development and severity of both psychiatric illness and AUD, effective pharmacological\ntreatments for these conditions remain very limited. In recent years, many people have turned to cannabis for\nmanagement of chronic pain and various negative emotional symptoms associated with mental illness.\nHowever, there is a significant gap in knowledge regarding the analgesic efficacy of primary cannabis\nconstituents in the context of alcohol dependence and how use may either mitigate or worsen the risk of\nsubstance use disorders. Specifically, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive component\nof cannabis, may offer a promising avenue for pain management, a common cause of excessive drinking in\nindividuals with AUD. From a neurobiological perspective, the extended amygdala (EA) plays an important role\nin stress- and pain-related components of AUD and is a site where the endocannabinoid (eCB) system\nappears critical for modulating the reinforcing effects of ethanol and transition to dependence. Our previous\npreclinical work has shown a functional role for the central amygdala (CeA), a constituent of the EA, as a key\nbrain region underlying hyperalgesia and escalation of alcohol drinking in alcohol-dependent animal models.\nOur preliminary data indicate an eCB system dysregulation generated by chronic alcohol exposure, which may\npromote the use of alcohol and imply the therapeutic efficacy of cannabis/THC in individuals suffering from\nAUD and AUD-related hyperalgesia. The main research objective of the current proposal is to investigate the\nintricate interplay between the endocannabinoid system, pain, and alcohol use. The studies outlined in this F30\ntraining proposal incorporate both animal modeling and clinical investigation to examine the predictions that: 1)\ndelta-9-THC administration alleviates hyperalgesia and reduces escalated alcohol self-administration in\nalcohol-dependent male and female rats, and 2) increased cannabis use is associated with overall reductions\nin pain symptoms and at-risk alcohol use in men and women. This proposal will provide a promising future\nphysician-scientist with vital research training to become an independent scientist in the field of alcohol and\nclinical neuroscience research.",

      "abstract_text": "PP2A B\u2019 subunit regulates synaptic development and cognition \u2014 learning from human\nmutations\nAbstract\nIntellectual disability (ID) is a severe neurological condition affecting up to 3% of the general\npopulation. There is currently no pharmacological treatment for ID patients. Gene-association\nstudies in ID patients identified an increasing number of genes. However, a vast gap persists\nbetween gene discovery and treatment due to our poor understanding of the molecular\nmechanisms linking cognition and genes. Two ID-linked genes are PPP2R5C and PPP2R5D,\nboth encoding brain-enriched B56 regulatory subunits of the PP2A phosphatase complex.\nHowever, it is unclear how the ID-linked mutations in PPP2R5C or PPP2R5D affect the B56\nsubunit action and subsequent cognitive function. Our studies on wrd, the sole fly orthologue of\nboth PPP2R5C and PPP2R5D, shed light on how these specific subunits of PP2A\nphosphatases regulate synaptic development, neural-activity-driven synaptic structural\nremodeling, learning and memory. We found that Wrd-PP2A mediates dephosphorylation\nevents crucial for structural plasticity at the nerve terminals. Loss of wrd function destabilizes\nactive zones at the larval glutamatergic neuromuscular junctions, diminishes light-induced\nremodeling of active zones at the photoreceptor synapses, and impairs gustatory learning in the\nadult stage. Transiently expressing Wrd protein in adulthood restores the gustatory learning\ndefect in the wrd null mutant flies. These findings together suggest an exciting potential for\nboosting Wrd-PP2A activity (or inhibiting antagonizing kinases of Wrd-PP2A) as a treatment for\nID. In this grant, we propose to generate and study fly Wrd transgenes that mimic the ID-linked\nmutations in human patients. Our study will establish a fly model to dissect the molecular\nmechanisms underlying the root causes of B56-dependent cognitive dysfunctions, paving the\nroad for future therapeutic approaches in treating B56-linked and other forms of ID.",

      "abstract_text": "Abstract Alcohol-mediated mitochondrial adaptations in skeletal muscle: role of Sirtuin1\nThe goal of this Ruth L.\nKirschstein\nNRSA F32 application is to prepare the applicant for an academic career as\nan alcohol researcher. The applicant will have the invaluable opportunity to be trained in alcohol research, and\ntransition from basic science research to translational research. Alcohol-induced skeletal muscle dysfunction\naffects 50% of individuals with alcohol use disorder. Skeletal muscle mitochondrial dysfunction is a salient\nmechanism contributing to myopathy and data from the laboratory demonstrates that alcohol increases reactive\noxygen species production and reduces mitochondrial membrane potential in primary skeletal muscle myoblasts.\nHowever, the alcohol-mediated specific mechanisms leading to impaired bioenergetic capacity and disrupted\ncellular redox homeostasis in skeletal muscle remain incompletely understood. Sirtuin-1 (SIRT1), a NAD+-\ndependent class-III protein deacetylase, regulates mitochondrial dynamics, biogenesis, and bioenergetic\ncapacity. The inhibition of SIRT1 is correlated with increased mitochondrial fission, and exercise-induced\nincreases in NAD+ levels increase skeletal muscle SIRT1 activity, positively influencing energy metabolism. We\npostulate that these alterations arise from increased mitochondrial fission, driven by decreased Sirt1 activity.\nPreliminary data generated for this application indicate that in differentiated primary human myotubes, electrical\npulse stimulation increases ethanol-induced reductions in Sirt1 activity. However, the precise mechanisms by\nwhich Sirt1-induced deacetylation impacts mitochondrial dynamics and contributes to alcohol-mediated\ndysregulated skeletal muscle bioenergetics remain incompletely understood. Taken together, preliminary data\nand published literature provide evidence of alcohol-mediated mitochondrial adaptations leading to skeletal\nmuscle dysfunction. We hypothesize that alcohol dysregulates mitochondrial bioenergetics in myotubes derived\nfrom humans by increasing mitochondrial fission and reducing mitochondrial respiration, in a Sirt1 dependent\nmanner. Additionally, we propose to explore the potential of electrical pulse stimulation to identify the alcohol-\nassociated mitochondrial dysfunction mechanisms that can be positively influenced by exercise. With a strong\nmentoring team, including clinician scientists, completion of the proposed training plan in alcohol-related\nresearch will ensure that the applicant is equipped for a successful career in alcohol translational research.",

      "abstract_text": "Abstract\nTraumatic brain injury (TBI) affects millions of otherwise healthy individuals annually. A significant risk factor for\nTBI is alcohol intoxication, with 30-50% of TBI cases in the US attributed to alcohol-intoxication at the time of\ninjury, potentially intensifying cognitive deficits and TBI-related disability, particularly in moderate to severe\ncases. Moreover, following TBI, approximately 25% of TBI patients resume alcohol consumption, which can\nalso contribute to neuropathological outcomes. Several mechanisms can contribute to greater injury in alcohol\nand TBI comorbid conditions. Prior work from our laboratory has shown enhanced neuroinflammation at site of\nTBI in rodents exposed to alcohol, and delayed recovery of neurobehavioral function in TBI followed by alcohol\nexposure. Enhanced neuroinflammation may be the result of mitochondrial components or metabolic\nbyproducts that act as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Alcohol and TBI both alter cellular\nmetabolism, affects mitochondrial function and glutathione availability. The TBI and alcohol associated\ndisruption in brain metabolism, requires metabolic flexibility in energy substrate utilization to maintain adequate\nATP production. This metabolic shift may lead to glutathione depletion and reactive oxygen species\noverproduction, triggering cell death and accentuated neuropathology that can significantly impact recovery\nfrom TBI. Based on these data, we hypothesize that alcohol exacerbates TBI-induced alterations in\nmitochondrial bioenergetics; particularly at the site of injury, leading to increased oxidative stress and cell\ndeath. Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent programmed cell death mechanism, is highly sensitive to mitochondrial\nbioenergetic alterations and is reported in TBI. The research-training plan proposes three specific aims to test\nthe hypothesis that a) alcohol impairs mitochondrial bioenergetics at the site of TBI injury, b) alcohol\naccentuates oxidative stress affecting predominantly astrocytes at the site of TBI, c) and that ferroptosis is a\nsignificant contributor to cell death at the TBI site. The applicant will leverage his background training in\nmitochondrial mechanisms of tissue injury, translating them from cardiac tissue to the brain and from ischemic\ninjury to TBI, with emphasis of the role of alcohol in exacerbating these pathophysiological mechanisms.",

SCMM prides itself on bringing a critical mass of medical\nmycology researchers together from the south central region of the United States to share the\nlatest research being conducted in the various labs, provide opportunities for collaboration, and\npromote the development of junior trainees in participating laboratories. The meeting site rotates\nbetween university-centered locations in the south central region where fungal-centric\nlaboratories are located. Principal Investigators and students/postdocs from ~15 laboratories\nusually attend annually (including laboratories in the host city). In total there are upwards of 20\nlaboratories that have attended one or more of the meetings depending on the location site. A\nstrong and growing critical mass of medical mycologists have supported this meeting and led to\nits longevity and significance over the past 20 years. Although the meeting format has evolved\nover the years, the current format has focused on oral presentations by trainees regarding their\nmost exciting and impactful unpublished data. The small group setting provides a welcoming\nenvironment that has been successful in promoting discussion and constructive feedback for\ntrainees. Hence, the primary objectives of the meeting are to 1) bring regionally-based medical\nmycologists together to share research, initiate collaborations, and provide a venue for trainees\nto present their latest work, and 2) promote the development of young/junior scientists as a\nmentoring tool to facilitate their transition into academic scientists or their chosen career path.\nThe funding request is for trainee travel awards (n=10), costs of the venue, and to partially\ncover travel costs for the keynote speaker.",

      "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nAfrican Americans have both the highest incidence and mortality of lung cancer compared to any\nother racial/ethnic group. A possible explanation for this disparity is that African Americans (AA)\nmay be less likely to utilize preventative screenings such as Low-dose computed tomography\n(LDCT), which has the potential to encourage smokers to quit smoking successfully. In 2021, the\nUSPSTF expanded their lung cancer screening (LCS) recommendations to include individuals\nages 50-80 years with at least a 20 pack-year history, increasing the number of eligible U.S.\nadults. While the expanded criteria are expected to increase the number of high-risk individuals\neligible for screening and reduce lung cancer mortality, the impact on racial and ethnic minorities,\nincluding African Americans, has shown mixed findings. This is problematic as previous research\nhas found that African Americans may have different quit behaviors than whites. While use of\nLCS as a teachable moment for tobacco cessation is important, currently, there is no well-\nintegrated, comprehensive, culturally relevant community-engaged, sustainable program. Still, it\nis not clear whether the synergy effect of smoking cessation and LDCT LCS intervention was\nobserved in both quitting behaviors and LDCT uptake among African-American smokers. To\naddress this urgent public health concern, this study aims to reduce disparities and the burden of\nlung cancer among AA smokers by supporting a Multiple-level intervention integrating lung cancer\nscreening and smoking cessation(MILS), followed the NIH DEIA strategies using multilevel\ninterventions that impact determinants of health and address health disparities at appropriate time\npoints across the life course. Aim 1) Investigate smokers' and providers' attitudes, knowledge,\nand experiences with the expanded 2021 USPSTF LCS recommendations. Aim 2) Compare the\neffectiveness of a MILS vs. usual care on the biochemically-validated 7-day point-prevalence\ntobacco abstinence rates, LDCT uptake, nicotine dependence and stage of change was\nassessed. Aim 3) Explore barriers and facilitators that influence primary outcomes at the\ncommunity, provider, and individual levels for the improvement of a multilevel intervention. To\ndate, no study has evaluated the synergy effect of smoking cessation intervention and LDCT LCS\nin AA populations with multilevel strategies. We will move the field forward by providing effective,\nscalable interventions to improve both smoking cessation and LDCT lung cancer screening\nadherence to reduce health disparities promised by large clinical trials that motivated screening\nguidelines. The results of the study will directly guide the development of targeted strategies to\nimprove lung cancer screening rates among minorities.",

      "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT\nPeople living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (PLWH) remain at increased risk of developing\nhead and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC) due to oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, despite\nadequate management of HIV with effective antiretroviral therapy (ART). Clinical observations have indicated\nincreased risk of oral HPV infection and pathology in PLWH after they begin taking ART and concurrent with a\nsignificant drop in HIV viral burden. Prior in vitro studies using 3D experimental tissue models that mimic stratified\nsquamous epithelium have suggested that exposure of the tissue to ART agents disrupts the structural integrity\nof the tissue and enhances susceptibility to HPV infection. These findings have not been corroborated in clinical\nstudies using relevant oral mucosal samples from PLWH. We hypothesize that ART damages the integrity of the\noral mucosa and enhances acquisition of HPV infection in vivo. Further, we posit that individuals that are taking\nART for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent HIV infection will exhibit tissue damage and HPV\nsusceptibility similar to that of PLWH who are taking ART to manage their HIV infection. Three specific aims are\nproposed to investigate these hypotheses: 1) to compare the prevalence and incidence of oral HPV infection in\nPLWH taking ART and people taking ART for PrEP to risk-matched HIV seronegative, ART-na\u00efve controls; 2) to\nexamine the architecture of oral mucosal tissue in subjects taking ART/PrEP for evidence of damage to the\nintegrity of the mucosal barrier; and 3) to determine the effect of taking ART/PrEP on tissue susceptibility to HPV\ninfection by experimental challenge of patient oral biopsy-derived 3D tissues with HPV16 in vitro. These studies\nwill, for the first time, discern the role of ART apart from HIV infection on oral mucosa integrity and susceptibility\nto oral HPV infection. This is significant because understanding the interplay between HIV, ART and HPV will\nreveal new opportunities to prevent HNSCC that take into consideration the effects of ART on patient risk.",

      "abstract_text": "Pancreatic cancer is a lethal malignancy. Even with surgical resection, the recurrence rate is high, and chemotherapy is recommended for all patients due to the systemic nature of the disease. A major treatment challenge is the high rate of resistance to the available treatments. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop novel treatment modalities with effective and durable responses. Immunotherapy has recently revolutionized the treatment of several malignancies. While these patients have a durable response to immunotherapy and benefit from improved survival, many solid tumors and in particular, pancreatic cancer, do not respond to standard immunotherapy. They do not elicit a significant immune response and are considered immunologically \u201ccold\u201d tumors. A dense tumor microenvironment is a physical barrier against treatment delivery. It also suppresses the immune system to fight against cancer. Therefore, a multi-modality approach targeting tumor cells and tumor microenvironment can overcome treatment resistance more effectively. Converting \u201ccold\u201d tumors to \u201chot\u201d tumors is an area of great interest in immuno-oncology research. Oncolytic viruses are one of the desirable platforms for this purpose. Their anti-cancer activity is not only the direct killing of tumor cells but also modulating the immune response against cancer. In this project, we have designed novel oncolytic viruses, on a vesicular stomatitis virus backbone, that are bioengineered to express enzymes that target the stroma and tumor microenvironment. In addition, they express antibodies against the immune checkpoint LAG-3. Immune checkpoints inhibit immune response against tumors and by blocking them, they can prevent tumor evasion from the immune system. The combination of LAG-3 inhibition with conventional immune checkpoint inhibitors (PD-1 inhibitors) has been recently shown to enhance immunotherapy efficacy and reverse resistance to PD-1 inhibitors. We hypothesize that this multi-target design offers a comprehensive approach against important resistance mechanisms in pancreatic cancer and not only offers an effective immunotherapeutic approach but also improves the response to available conventional therapies. This study aims to investigate whether targeting the extracellular matrix with the oncolytic virus platform improves anti-tumor toxicity. It determines whether dual targeting of the tumor microenvironment and immune checkpoint inhibition with this oncolytic virus elicits an enhanced immune response. Finally, we will investigate whether combining this novel oncolytic virus with PD-1 inhibitors and standard chemotherapy can elicit safe and effective tumor toxicity and enhanced immune response and if the approach can convert the \u201ccold\u201d tumors to \u201chot\u201d tumors. Validating our hypothesis in preclinical models provides the required evidence for designing clinical trials that investigate the treatment efficacy and safety of this approach in pancreatic cancer patients. Establishing a successful immunotherapeutic approach can revolutionize the treatment of pancreatic cancer.",

      "abstract_text": "Despite the progress in the fight against HIV/AIDS, women around the world remain disproportionately\naffected by HIV. More than half of the HIV cases globally are women, and young women are as twice as\nlikely as young men to acquire HIV. Biological factors have all been suggested to increase women\u2019s risk to\nHIV, and are compounded by social factors such as stigma, social norms, and barriers to accessing sexual\nand reproductive health services. Consequently, women living with HIV (WLWH) experience mental health\nillnesses like stress, depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress symptoms at higher rates than their male\ncounterparts and more often than HIV-unaffected women. These mental health issues affect not only the\nwell-being and quality of life of WLWH but have implications for HIV management and transmission\nprevention. While mental illnesses have significant impact on management of HIV disease, data on the\nburden of mental illnesses and their impact in SSA where most of the PLHIV are residing is lacking. The lack\nof well-trained HIV researchers in mental health and women\u2019s health has also contributed to the low\nunderstanding of comorbidities affecting WLWH in SSA. Therefore, there is a need to build research capacity\nin HIV and mental health particularly among WLWH by investigating the impact of depression on health of\nWLWH in SSA countries like Tanzania, where HIV prevalence is still high at 4.4% in the general population\nbut higher in women at 5.6%. The ongoing Tanzania AIDS Malignancies Research and Training Program\nD43 (TW012277) provides a unique opportunity to train young investigators in the field of HIV-associated\nmalignancy research to address some of the challenges highlighted. We are proposing to mentor a junior\nfemale faculty oncologist who can lead a study in establishing the burden and impact of depression on health\nof WLWH in the country. We hypothesize that WLWH, especially those diagnosed with cancers, will have\nhigh rates of depression, and this condition will negatively influence their ability to control HIV disease. To\ntest this hypothesis, the team will: a) enroll women (HIV+/HIV-, and cancer+/cancer-) at Ocean Road Cancer\nInstitute in Tanzania and establish the burden of depression among WLWH by using a validated depression\nassessment tool, PHQ-9. Information on ART use and its adherence, CD4 counts, HIV viral load, and HIV\ndisease stage will also be systematically documented; b) assess the impact of depression on health of WLWH\nby analyzing severity of depression and how it affects outcomes of WLWH in terms of ART adherence, HIV\nplasma viral load suppression, and HIV disease stage. The proposed study will provide a unique opportunity\nfor a new investigator (Dr. Queen) to acquire new skills in HIV, mental health, and women\u2019s health research\nas a stepping-stone to embark on HIV/AIDS research career and improve research capacity in Tanzania.\nThe generated mental health and outcomes data will be important preliminary data for future research and\ncrucial in designing future strategies to improve health outcomes for WLWH in SSA and beyond.",

      "phr_text": "NARRATIVE\nDespite the progress in the fight against HIV/AIDS for over the last 40 years, women around the world\nremain disproportionately affected by HIV, especially in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) where women living with\nHIV (WLWH) experience mental health illnesses like stress, depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress\nsymptoms at higher rates than their male counterparts and more often than HIV-unaffected women. The\noverall objective of this supplement is to mentor and support a recently graduated female oncologist, Dr.\nQueen Tarimo and bridge her into HIV, mental health, and women\u2019s health research, to characterize\nseverity of depression and its impact on WLWH and how this condition affects their health outcomes. The\nproposed study is significant as it provides a unique opportunity for a new investigator to acquire new\nresearch skills in HIV, mental health, and women\u2019s health as a stepping-stone to embark on HIV/AIDS\nresearch career, and the generated preliminary data will be important for future research and crucial in\ndesigning strategies to improve health outcomes for WLWH in SSA and beyond.",

Much of the applicant\u2019s career\ndevelopment will come from work in alcohol and cardiovascular-related research. Alcohol-related\nCardiomyopathy (AC) manifests in humans after excessive alcohol consumption and is\ncharacterized by ventricular dilation and cardiac function impairment. During cardiac inflammation\nand injury, fibroblasts differentiate into myofibroblasts, which are larger in cell size and express\nhigher levels of collagens and their crosslinking enzyme lysyl oxidase (LOX). Here, the role of\nTRAF3IP2, a proinflammatory cytoplasmic adapter protein, in the pathogenesis of AC is explored.\nPreliminary data indicates that exposure of na\u00efve cardiac fibroblasts (CF) to alcohol induces\nTRAF3IP2 protein expression in a time- and dose-dependent manner. In our studies, we will\ninvestigate whether i) alcohol-induced cardiac fibroblast activation, and proinflammatory cytokine\nand extracellular matrix expression are dependent on TRAF3IP2 and ii) global TRAF3IP2 gene\ndeletion prevents alcohol-induced cardiac inflammation, fibrosis, and dysfunction.\nThe cellular mechanism underlying alcohol-induced cardiac inflammation and fibrosis are\ninvestigated using both in vitro and in vivo alcohol exposure. In vitro, TRAF3IP2 is targeted using\nna\u00efve CF from wild-type mice transduced with TRAF3IP2 shRNA and CF isolated from\nhomozygous TRAF3IP2 knockout mice. In vivo, TRAF3IP2 is targeted using global TRAF3IP2-\nknockout mice on a 30-day Lieber-DeCarli or isocaloric control liquid diet based on the\nchronic+binge model. Endpoint measures include induction of proinflammatory and profibrotic\npathways.\nUsing the chronic+binge model of AC, TRAF3IP2-KO and littermate controls are exposed to\nchronic alcohol consumption. Endpoints include assessment of cardiac function and chamber\ndimensions by echocardiography and pressure-volume left ventricular catheterization. Markers of\ninflammation and fibrotic measures include collagens I and III, LOX expression, left ventricle total\ncollagen, and histological assessment of interstitial fibrosis by PSR staining.\nUltimately, these studies may identify novel, therapeutic targets for the treatment of alcohol-\nrelated cardiomyopathy. With the support of a strong mentoring team, completion of the proposed\nresearch and training plan will ensure that the applicant is prepared for an impactful career as a\nphysician-scientist.",

      "abstract_text": "Abstract\nAlcohol use disorder (AUD) affects more than 10% of the United States population. AUD is a psychiatric\ndisorder characterized by escalated alcohol drinking and the emergence of profound negative affective states,\nincluding persistent pain. Alcohol is also known for its analgesic effects, although excessive use facilitates pain\nsensitivity (or hyperalgesia) during withdrawal. While chronic pain affects over 20% of the global population\nand contributes to the development and severity of both psychiatric illness and AUD, effective pharmacological\ntreatments for these conditions remain very limited. In recent years, many people have turned to cannabis for\nmanagement of chronic pain and various negative emotional symptoms associated with mental illness.\nHowever, there is a significant gap in knowledge regarding the analgesic efficacy of primary cannabis\nconstituents in the context of alcohol dependence and how use may either mitigate or worsen the risk of\nsubstance use disorders. Specifically, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive component\nof cannabis, may offer a promising avenue for pain management, a common cause of excessive drinking in\nindividuals with AUD. From a neurobiological perspective, the extended amygdala (EA) plays an important role\nin stress- and pain-related components of AUD and is a site where the endocannabinoid (eCB) system\nappears critical for modulating the reinforcing effects of ethanol and transition to dependence. Our previous\npreclinical work has shown a functional role for the central amygdala (CeA), a constituent of the EA, as a key\nbrain region underlying hyperalgesia and escalation of alcohol drinking in alcohol-dependent animal models.\nOur preliminary data indicate an eCB system dysregulation generated by chronic alcohol exposure, which may\npromote the use of alcohol and imply the therapeutic efficacy of cannabis/THC in individuals suffering from\nAUD and AUD-related hyperalgesia. The main research objective of the current proposal is to investigate the\nintricate interplay between the endocannabinoid system, pain, and alcohol use. The studies outlined in this F30\ntraining proposal incorporate both animal modeling and clinical investigation to examine the predictions that: 1)\ndelta-9-THC administration alleviates hyperalgesia and reduces escalated alcohol self-administration in\nalcohol-dependent male and female rats, and 2) increased cannabis use is associated with overall reductions\nin pain symptoms and at-risk alcohol use in men and women. This proposal will provide a promising future\nphysician-scientist with vital research training to become an independent scientist in the field of alcohol and\nclinical neuroscience research.",

      "abstract_text": "PP2A B\u2019 subunit regulates synaptic development and cognition \u2014 learning from human\nmutations\nAbstract\nIntellectual disability (ID) is a severe neurological condition affecting up to 3% of the general\npopulation. There is currently no pharmacological treatment for ID patients. Gene-association\nstudies in ID patients identified an increasing number of genes. However, a vast gap persists\nbetween gene discovery and treatment due to our poor understanding of the molecular\nmechanisms linking cognition and genes. Two ID-linked genes are PPP2R5C and PPP2R5D,\nboth encoding brain-enriched B56 regulatory subunits of the PP2A phosphatase complex.\nHowever, it is unclear how the ID-linked mutations in PPP2R5C or PPP2R5D affect the B56\nsubunit action and subsequent cognitive function. Our studies on wrd, the sole fly orthologue of\nboth PPP2R5C and PPP2R5D, shed light on how these specific subunits of PP2A\nphosphatases regulate synaptic development, neural-activity-driven synaptic structural\nremodeling, learning and memory. We found that Wrd-PP2A mediates dephosphorylation\nevents crucial for structural plasticity at the nerve terminals. Loss of wrd function destabilizes\nactive zones at the larval glutamatergic neuromuscular junctions, diminishes light-induced\nremodeling of active zones at the photoreceptor synapses, and impairs gustatory learning in the\nadult stage. Transiently expressing Wrd protein in adulthood restores the gustatory learning\ndefect in the wrd null mutant flies. These findings together suggest an exciting potential for\nboosting Wrd-PP2A activity (or inhibiting antagonizing kinases of Wrd-PP2A) as a treatment for\nID. In this grant, we propose to generate and study fly Wrd transgenes that mimic the ID-linked\nmutations in human patients. Our study will establish a fly model to dissect the molecular\nmechanisms underlying the root causes of B56-dependent cognitive dysfunctions, paving the\nroad for future therapeutic approaches in treating B56-linked and other forms of ID.",

      "abstract_text": "Abstract Alcohol-mediated mitochondrial adaptations in skeletal muscle: role of Sirtuin1\nThe goal of this Ruth L.\nKirschstein\nNRSA F32 application is to prepare the applicant for an academic career as\nan alcohol researcher. The applicant will have the invaluable opportunity to be trained in alcohol research, and\ntransition from basic science research to translational research. Alcohol-induced skeletal muscle dysfunction\naffects 50% of individuals with alcohol use disorder. Skeletal muscle mitochondrial dysfunction is a salient\nmechanism contributing to myopathy and data from the laboratory demonstrates that alcohol increases reactive\noxygen species production and reduces mitochondrial membrane potential in primary skeletal muscle myoblasts.\nHowever, the alcohol-mediated specific mechanisms leading to impaired bioenergetic capacity and disrupted\ncellular redox homeostasis in skeletal muscle remain incompletely understood. Sirtuin-1 (SIRT1), a NAD+-\ndependent class-III protein deacetylase, regulates mitochondrial dynamics, biogenesis, and bioenergetic\ncapacity. The inhibition of SIRT1 is correlated with increased mitochondrial fission, and exercise-induced\nincreases in NAD+ levels increase skeletal muscle SIRT1 activity, positively influencing energy metabolism. We\npostulate that these alterations arise from increased mitochondrial fission, driven by decreased Sirt1 activity.\nPreliminary data generated for this application indicate that in differentiated primary human myotubes, electrical\npulse stimulation increases ethanol-induced reductions in Sirt1 activity. However, the precise mechanisms by\nwhich Sirt1-induced deacetylation impacts mitochondrial dynamics and contributes to alcohol-mediated\ndysregulated skeletal muscle bioenergetics remain incompletely understood. Taken together, preliminary data\nand published literature provide evidence of alcohol-mediated mitochondrial adaptations leading to skeletal\nmuscle dysfunction. We hypothesize that alcohol dysregulates mitochondrial bioenergetics in myotubes derived\nfrom humans by increasing mitochondrial fission and reducing mitochondrial respiration, in a Sirt1 dependent\nmanner. Additionally, we propose to explore the potential of electrical pulse stimulation to identify the alcohol-\nassociated mitochondrial dysfunction mechanisms that can be positively influenced by exercise. With a strong\nmentoring team, including clinician scientists, completion of the proposed training plan in alcohol-related\nresearch will ensure that the applicant is equipped for a successful career in alcohol translational research.",

      "abstract_text": "Abstract\nTraumatic brain injury (TBI) affects millions of otherwise healthy individuals annually. A significant risk factor for\nTBI is alcohol intoxication, with 30-50% of TBI cases in the US attributed to alcohol-intoxication at the time of\ninjury, potentially intensifying cognitive deficits and TBI-related disability, particularly in moderate to severe\ncases. Moreover, following TBI, approximately 25% of TBI patients resume alcohol consumption, which can\nalso contribute to neuropathological outcomes. Several mechanisms can contribute to greater injury in alcohol\nand TBI comorbid conditions. Prior work from our laboratory has shown enhanced neuroinflammation at site of\nTBI in rodents exposed to alcohol, and delayed recovery of neurobehavioral function in TBI followed by alcohol\nexposure. Enhanced neuroinflammation may be the result of mitochondrial components or metabolic\nbyproducts that act as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Alcohol and TBI both alter cellular\nmetabolism, affects mitochondrial function and glutathione availability. The TBI and alcohol associated\ndisruption in brain metabolism, requires metabolic flexibility in energy substrate utilization to maintain adequate\nATP production. This metabolic shift may lead to glutathione depletion and reactive oxygen species\noverproduction, triggering cell death and accentuated neuropathology that can significantly impact recovery\nfrom TBI. Based on these data, we hypothesize that alcohol exacerbates TBI-induced alterations in\nmitochondrial bioenergetics; particularly at the site of injury, leading to increased oxidative stress and cell\ndeath. Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent programmed cell death mechanism, is highly sensitive to mitochondrial\nbioenergetic alterations and is reported in TBI. The research-training plan proposes three specific aims to test\nthe hypothesis that a) alcohol impairs mitochondrial bioenergetics at the site of TBI injury, b) alcohol\naccentuates oxidative stress affecting predominantly astrocytes at the site of TBI, c) and that ferroptosis is a\nsignificant contributor to cell death at the TBI site. The applicant will leverage his background training in\nmitochondrial mechanisms of tissue injury, translating them from cardiac tissue to the brain and from ischemic\ninjury to TBI, with emphasis of the role of alcohol in exacerbating these pathophysiological mechanisms.",

      "phr_text": "Narrative\nThis study seeks to elucidate the impact of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) and alcohol exposure on\nmitochondrial metabolism during the recovery phase. Additionally, it investigates the potential of alcohol to\ntrigger ferroptosis, a specific cell death process, through mitochondrial pathways in the context of TBI recovery.\nThe research aims to provide insights into the complex interplay between TBI, alcohol, and mitochondrial\nprocesses, shedding light on potential mechanisms underlying cellular responses during the recovery period.",

      "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nAfrican Americans have both the highest incidence and mortality of lung cancer compared to any\nother racial/ethnic group. A possible explanation for this disparity is that African Americans (AA)\nmay be less likely to utilize preventative screenings such as Low-dose computed tomography\n(LDCT), which has the potential to encourage smokers to quit smoking successfully. In 2021, the\nUSPSTF expanded their lung cancer screening (LCS) recommendations to include individuals\nages 50-80 years with at least a 20 pack-year history, increasing the number of eligible U.S.\nadults. While the expanded criteria are expected to increase the number of high-risk individuals\neligible for screening and reduce lung cancer mortality, the impact on racial and ethnic minorities,\nincluding African Americans, has shown mixed findings. This is problematic as previous research\nhas found that African Americans may have different quit behaviors than whites. While use of\nLCS as a teachable moment for tobacco cessation is important, currently, there is no well-\nintegrated, comprehensive, culturally relevant community-engaged, sustainable program. Still, it\nis not clear whether the synergy effect of smoking cessation and LDCT LCS intervention was\nobserved in both quitting behaviors and LDCT uptake among African-American smokers. To\naddress this urgent public health concern, this study aims to reduce disparities and the burden of\nlung cancer among AA smokers by supporting a Multiple-level intervention integrating lung cancer\nscreening and smoking cessation(MILS), followed the NIH DEIA strategies using multilevel\ninterventions that impact determinants of health and address health disparities at appropriate time\npoints across the life course. Aim 1) Investigate smokers' and providers' attitudes, knowledge,\nand experiences with the expanded 2021 USPSTF LCS recommendations. Aim 2) Compare the\neffectiveness of a MILS vs. usual care on the biochemically-validated 7-day point-prevalence\ntobacco abstinence rates, LDCT uptake, nicotine dependence and stage of change was\nassessed. Aim 3) Explore barriers and facilitators that influence primary outcomes at the\ncommunity, provider, and individual levels for the improvement of a multilevel intervention. To\ndate, no study has evaluated the synergy effect of smoking cessation intervention and LDCT LCS\nin AA populations with multilevel strategies. We will move the field forward by providing effective,\nscalable interventions to improve both smoking cessation and LDCT lung cancer screening\nadherence to reduce health disparities promised by large clinical trials that motivated screening\nguidelines. The results of the study will directly guide the development of targeted strategies to\nimprove lung cancer screening rates among minorities.",

      "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT\nPeople living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (PLWH) remain at increased risk of developing\nhead and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC) due to oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, despite\nadequate management of HIV with effective antiretroviral therapy (ART). Clinical observations have indicated\nincreased risk of oral HPV infection and pathology in PLWH after they begin taking ART and concurrent with a\nsignificant drop in HIV viral burden. Prior in vitro studies using 3D experimental tissue models that mimic stratified\nsquamous epithelium have suggested that exposure of the tissue to ART agents disrupts the structural integrity\nof the tissue and enhances susceptibility to HPV infection. These findings have not been corroborated in clinical\nstudies using relevant oral mucosal samples from PLWH. We hypothesize that ART damages the integrity of the\noral mucosa and enhances acquisition of HPV infection in vivo. Further, we posit that individuals that are taking\nART for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent HIV infection will exhibit tissue damage and HPV\nsusceptibility similar to that of PLWH who are taking ART to manage their HIV infection. Three specific aims are\nproposed to investigate these hypotheses: 1) to compare the prevalence and incidence of oral HPV infection in\nPLWH taking ART and people taking ART for PrEP to risk-matched HIV seronegative, ART-na\u00efve controls; 2) to\nexamine the architecture of oral mucosal tissue in subjects taking ART/PrEP for evidence of damage to the\nintegrity of the mucosal barrier; and 3) to determine the effect of taking ART/PrEP on tissue susceptibility to HPV\ninfection by experimental challenge of patient oral biopsy-derived 3D tissues with HPV16 in vitro. These studies\nwill, for the first time, discern the role of ART apart from HIV infection on oral mucosa integrity and susceptibility\nto oral HPV infection. This is significant because understanding the interplay between HIV, ART and HPV will\nreveal new opportunities to prevent HNSCC that take into consideration the effects of ART on patient risk.",

      "abstract_text": "Pancreatic cancer is a lethal malignancy. Even with surgical resection, the recurrence rate is high, and chemotherapy is recommended for all patients due to the systemic nature of the disease. A major treatment challenge is the high rate of resistance to the available treatments. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop novel treatment modalities with effective and durable responses. Immunotherapy has recently revolutionized the treatment of several malignancies. While these patients have a durable response to immunotherapy and benefit from improved survival, many solid tumors and in particular, pancreatic cancer, do not respond to standard immunotherapy. They do not elicit a significant immune response and are considered immunologically \u201ccold\u201d tumors. A dense tumor microenvironment is a physical barrier against treatment delivery. It also suppresses the immune system to fight against cancer. Therefore, a multi-modality approach targeting tumor cells and tumor microenvironment can overcome treatment resistance more effectively. Converting \u201ccold\u201d tumors to \u201chot\u201d tumors is an area of great interest in immuno-oncology research. Oncolytic viruses are one of the desirable platforms for this purpose. Their anti-cancer activity is not only the direct killing of tumor cells but also modulating the immune response against cancer. In this project, we have designed novel oncolytic viruses, on a vesicular stomatitis virus backbone, that are bioengineered to express enzymes that target the stroma and tumor microenvironment. In addition, they express antibodies against the immune checkpoint LAG-3. Immune checkpoints inhibit immune response against tumors and by blocking them, they can prevent tumor evasion from the immune system. The combination of LAG-3 inhibition with conventional immune checkpoint inhibitors (PD-1 inhibitors) has been recently shown to enhance immunotherapy efficacy and reverse resistance to PD-1 inhibitors. We hypothesize that this multi-target design offers a comprehensive approach against important resistance mechanisms in pancreatic cancer and not only offers an effective immunotherapeutic approach but also improves the response to available conventional therapies. This study aims to investigate whether targeting the extracellular matrix with the oncolytic virus platform improves anti-tumor toxicity. It determines whether dual targeting of the tumor microenvironment and immune checkpoint inhibition with this oncolytic virus elicits an enhanced immune response. Finally, we will investigate whether combining this novel oncolytic virus with PD-1 inhibitors and standard chemotherapy can elicit safe and effective tumor toxicity and enhanced immune response and if the approach can convert the \u201ccold\u201d tumors to \u201chot\u201d tumors. Validating our hypothesis in preclinical models provides the required evidence for designing clinical trials that investigate the treatment efficacy and safety of this approach in pancreatic cancer patients. Establishing a successful immunotherapeutic approach can revolutionize the treatment of pancreatic cancer.",

      "abstract_text": "Despite the progress in the fight against HIV/AIDS, women around the world remain disproportionately\naffected by HIV. More than half of the HIV cases globally are women, and young women are as twice as\nlikely as young men to acquire HIV. Biological factors have all been suggested to increase women\u2019s risk to\nHIV, and are compounded by social factors such as stigma, social norms, and barriers to accessing sexual\nand reproductive health services. Consequently, women living with HIV (WLWH) experience mental health\nillnesses like stress, depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress symptoms at higher rates than their male\ncounterparts and more often than HIV-unaffected women. These mental health issues affect not only the\nwell-being and quality of life of WLWH but have implications for HIV management and transmission\nprevention. While mental illnesses have significant impact on management of HIV disease, data on the\nburden of mental illnesses and their impact in SSA where most of the PLHIV are residing is lacking. The lack\nof well-trained HIV researchers in mental health and women\u2019s health has also contributed to the low\nunderstanding of comorbidities affecting WLWH in SSA. Therefore, there is a need to build research capacity\nin HIV and mental health particularly among WLWH by investigating the impact of depression on health of\nWLWH in SSA countries like Tanzania, where HIV prevalence is still high at 4.4% in the general population\nbut higher in women at 5.6%. The ongoing Tanzania AIDS Malignancies Research and Training Program\nD43 (TW012277) provides a unique opportunity to train young investigators in the field of HIV-associated\nmalignancy research to address some of the challenges highlighted. We are proposing to mentor a junior\nfemale faculty oncologist who can lead a study in establishing the burden and impact of depression on health\nof WLWH in the country. We hypothesize that WLWH, especially those diagnosed with cancers, will have\nhigh rates of depression, and this condition will negatively influence their ability to control HIV disease. To\ntest this hypothesis, the team will: a) enroll women (HIV+/HIV-, and cancer+/cancer-) at Ocean Road Cancer\nInstitute in Tanzania and establish the burden of depression among WLWH by using a validated depression\nassessment tool, PHQ-9. Information on ART use and its adherence, CD4 counts, HIV viral load, and HIV\ndisease stage will also be systematically documented; b) assess the impact of depression on health of WLWH\nby analyzing severity of depression and how it affects outcomes of WLWH in terms of ART adherence, HIV\nplasma viral load suppression, and HIV disease stage. The proposed study will provide a unique opportunity\nfor a new investigator (Dr. Queen) to acquire new skills in HIV, mental health, and women\u2019s health research\nas a stepping-stone to embark on HIV/AIDS research career and improve research capacity in Tanzania.\nThe generated mental health and outcomes data will be important preliminary data for future research and\ncrucial in designing future strategies to improve health outcomes for WLWH in SSA and beyond.",

      "abstract_text": "Abstract\nThis NRSA F30 fellowship will provide the groundwork that will prepare the applicant for a career\nin academic medicine as a cardiothoracic anesthesiologist. Much of the applicant\u2019s career\ndevelopment will come from work in alcohol and cardiovascular-related research. Alcohol-related\nCardiomyopathy (AC) manifests in humans after excessive alcohol consumption and is\ncharacterized by ventricular dilation and cardiac function impairment. During cardiac inflammation\nand injury, fibroblasts differentiate into myofibroblasts, which are larger in cell size and express\nhigher levels of collagens and their crosslinking enzyme lysyl oxidase (LOX). Here, the role of\nTRAF3IP2, a proinflammatory cytoplasmic adapter protein, in the pathogenesis of AC is explored.\nPreliminary data indicates that exposure of na\u00efve cardiac fibroblasts (CF) to alcohol induces\nTRAF3IP2 protein expression in a time- and dose-dependent manner. In our studies, we will\ninvestigate whether i) alcohol-induced cardiac fibroblast activation, and proinflammatory cytokine\nand extracellular matrix expression are dependent on TRAF3IP2 and ii) global TRAF3IP2 gene\ndeletion prevents alcohol-induced cardiac inflammation, fibrosis, and dysfunction.\nThe cellular mechanism underlying alcohol-induced cardiac inflammation and fibrosis are\ninvestigated using both in vitro and in vivo alcohol exposure. In vitro, TRAF3IP2 is targeted using\nna\u00efve CF from wild-type mice transduced with TRAF3IP2 shRNA and CF isolated from\nhomozygous TRAF3IP2 knockout mice. In vivo, TRAF3IP2 is targeted using global TRAF3IP2-\nknockout mice on a 30-day Lieber-DeCarli or isocaloric control liquid diet based on the\nchronic+binge model. Endpoint measures include induction of proinflammatory and profibrotic\npathways.\nUsing the chronic+binge model of AC, TRAF3IP2-KO and littermate controls are exposed to\nchronic alcohol consumption. Endpoints include assessment of cardiac function and chamber\ndimensions by echocardiography and pressure-volume left ventricular catheterization. Markers of\ninflammation and fibrotic measures include collagens I and III, LOX expression, left ventricle total\ncollagen, and histological assessment of interstitial fibrosis by PSR staining.\nUltimately, these studies may identify novel, therapeutic targets for the treatment of alcohol-\nrelated cardiomyopathy. With the support of a strong mentoring team, completion of the proposed\nresearch and training plan will ensure that the applicant is prepared for an impactful career as a\nphysician-scientist.",

      "abstract_text": "Abstract\nAlcohol use disorder (AUD) affects more than 10% of the United States population. AUD is a psychiatric\ndisorder characterized by escalated alcohol drinking and the emergence of profound negative affective states,\nincluding persistent pain. Alcohol is also known for its analgesic effects, although excessive use facilitates pain\nsensitivity (or hyperalgesia) during withdrawal. While chronic pain affects over 20% of the global population\nand contributes to the development and severity of both psychiatric illness and AUD, effective pharmacological\ntreatments for these conditions remain very limited. In recent years, many people have turned to cannabis for\nmanagement of chronic pain and various negative emotional symptoms associated with mental illness.\nHowever, there is a significant gap in knowledge regarding the analgesic efficacy of primary cannabis\nconstituents in the context of alcohol dependence and how use may either mitigate or worsen the risk of\nsubstance use disorders. Specifically, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive component\nof cannabis, may offer a promising avenue for pain management, a common cause of excessive drinking in\nindividuals with AUD. From a neurobiological perspective, the extended amygdala (EA) plays an important role\nin stress- and pain-related components of AUD and is a site where the endocannabinoid (eCB) system\nappears critical for modulating the reinforcing effects of ethanol and transition to dependence. Our previous\npreclinical work has shown a functional role for the central amygdala (CeA), a constituent of the EA, as a key\nbrain region underlying hyperalgesia and escalation of alcohol drinking in alcohol-dependent animal models.\nOur preliminary data indicate an eCB system dysregulation generated by chronic alcohol exposure, which may\npromote the use of alcohol and imply the therapeutic efficacy of cannabis/THC in individuals suffering from\nAUD and AUD-related hyperalgesia. The main research objective of the current proposal is to investigate the\nintricate interplay between the endocannabinoid system, pain, and alcohol use. The studies outlined in this F30\ntraining proposal incorporate both animal modeling and clinical investigation to examine the predictions that: 1)\ndelta-9-THC administration alleviates hyperalgesia and reduces escalated alcohol self-administration in\nalcohol-dependent male and female rats, and 2) increased cannabis use is associated with overall reductions\nin pain symptoms and at-risk alcohol use in men and women. This proposal will provide a promising future\nphysician-scientist with vital research training to become an independent scientist in the field of alcohol and\nclinical neuroscience research.",

      "abstract_text": "PP2A B\u2019 subunit regulates synaptic development and cognition \u2014 learning from human\nmutations\nAbstract\nIntellectual disability (ID) is a severe neurological condition affecting up to 3% of the general\npopulation. There is currently no pharmacological treatment for ID patients. Gene-association\nstudies in ID patients identified an increasing number of genes. However, a vast gap persists\nbetween gene discovery and treatment due to our poor understanding of the molecular\nmechanisms linking cognition and genes. Two ID-linked genes are PPP2R5C and PPP2R5D,\nboth encoding brain-enriched B56 regulatory subunits of the PP2A phosphatase complex.\nHowever, it is unclear how the ID-linked mutations in PPP2R5C or PPP2R5D affect the B56\nsubunit action and subsequent cognitive function. Our studies on wrd, the sole fly orthologue of\nboth PPP2R5C and PPP2R5D, shed light on how these specific subunits of PP2A\nphosphatases regulate synaptic development, neural-activity-driven synaptic structural\nremodeling, learning and memory. We found that Wrd-PP2A mediates dephosphorylation\nevents crucial for structural plasticity at the nerve terminals. Loss of wrd function destabilizes\nactive zones at the larval glutamatergic neuromuscular junctions, diminishes light-induced\nremodeling of active zones at the photoreceptor synapses, and impairs gustatory learning in the\nadult stage. Transiently expressing Wrd protein in adulthood restores the gustatory learning\ndefect in the wrd null mutant flies. These findings together suggest an exciting potential for\nboosting Wrd-PP2A activity (or inhibiting antagonizing kinases of Wrd-PP2A) as a treatment for\nID. In this grant, we propose to generate and study fly Wrd transgenes that mimic the ID-linked\nmutations in human patients. Our study will establish a fly model to dissect the molecular\nmechanisms underlying the root causes of B56-dependent cognitive dysfunctions, paving the\nroad for future therapeutic approaches in treating B56-linked and other forms of ID.",

      "abstract_text": "Abstract Alcohol-mediated mitochondrial adaptations in skeletal muscle: role of Sirtuin1\nThe goal of this Ruth L.\nKirschstein\nNRSA F32 application is to prepare the applicant for an academic career as\nan alcohol researcher. The applicant will have the invaluable opportunity to be trained in alcohol research, and\ntransition from basic science research to translational research. Alcohol-induced skeletal muscle dysfunction\naffects 50% of individuals with alcohol use disorder. Skeletal muscle mitochondrial dysfunction is a salient\nmechanism contributing to myopathy and data from the laboratory demonstrates that alcohol increases reactive\noxygen species production and reduces mitochondrial membrane potential in primary skeletal muscle myoblasts.\nHowever, the alcohol-mediated specific mechanisms leading to impaired bioenergetic capacity and disrupted\ncellular redox homeostasis in skeletal muscle remain incompletely understood. Sirtuin-1 (SIRT1), a NAD+-\ndependent class-III protein deacetylase, regulates mitochondrial dynamics, biogenesis, and bioenergetic\ncapacity. The inhibition of SIRT1 is correlated with increased mitochondrial fission, and exercise-induced\nincreases in NAD+ levels increase skeletal muscle SIRT1 activity, positively influencing energy metabolism. We\npostulate that these alterations arise from increased mitochondrial fission, driven by decreased Sirt1 activity.\nPreliminary data generated for this application indicate that in differentiated primary human myotubes, electrical\npulse stimulation increases ethanol-induced reductions in Sirt1 activity. However, the precise mechanisms by\nwhich Sirt1-induced deacetylation impacts mitochondrial dynamics and contributes to alcohol-mediated\ndysregulated skeletal muscle bioenergetics remain incompletely understood. Taken together, preliminary data\nand published literature provide evidence of alcohol-mediated mitochondrial adaptations leading to skeletal\nmuscle dysfunction. We hypothesize that alcohol dysregulates mitochondrial bioenergetics in myotubes derived\nfrom humans by increasing mitochondrial fission and reducing mitochondrial respiration, in a Sirt1 dependent\nmanner. Additionally, we propose to explore the potential of electrical pulse stimulation to identify the alcohol-\nassociated mitochondrial dysfunction mechanisms that can be positively influenced by exercise. With a strong\nmentoring team, including clinician scientists, completion of the proposed training plan in alcohol-related\nresearch will ensure that the applicant is equipped for a successful career in alcohol translational research.",

      "abstract_text": "Abstract\nTraumatic brain injury (TBI) affects millions of otherwise healthy individuals annually. A significant risk factor for\nTBI is alcohol intoxication, with 30-50% of TBI cases in the US attributed to alcohol-intoxication at the time of\ninjury, potentially intensifying cognitive deficits and TBI-related disability, particularly in moderate to severe\ncases. Moreover, following TBI, approximately 25% of TBI patients resume alcohol consumption, which can\nalso contribute to neuropathological outcomes. Several mechanisms can contribute to greater injury in alcohol\nand TBI comorbid conditions. Prior work from our laboratory has shown enhanced neuroinflammation at site of\nTBI in rodents exposed to alcohol, and delayed recovery of neurobehavioral function in TBI followed by alcohol\nexposure. Enhanced neuroinflammation may be the result of mitochondrial components or metabolic\nbyproducts that act as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Alcohol and TBI both alter cellular\nmetabolism, affects mitochondrial function and glutathione availability. The TBI and alcohol associated\ndisruption in brain metabolism, requires metabolic flexibility in energy substrate utilization to maintain adequate\nATP production. This metabolic shift may lead to glutathione depletion and reactive oxygen species\noverproduction, triggering cell death and accentuated neuropathology that can significantly impact recovery\nfrom TBI. Based on these data, we hypothesize that alcohol exacerbates TBI-induced alterations in\nmitochondrial bioenergetics; particularly at the site of injury, leading to increased oxidative stress and cell\ndeath. Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent programmed cell death mechanism, is highly sensitive to mitochondrial\nbioenergetic alterations and is reported in TBI. The research-training plan proposes three specific aims to test\nthe hypothesis that a) alcohol impairs mitochondrial bioenergetics at the site of TBI injury, b) alcohol\naccentuates oxidative stress affecting predominantly astrocytes at the site of TBI, c) and that ferroptosis is a\nsignificant contributor to cell death at the TBI site. The applicant will leverage his background training in\nmitochondrial mechanisms of tissue injury, translating them from cardiac tissue to the brain and from ischemic\ninjury to TBI, with emphasis of the role of alcohol in exacerbating these pathophysiological mechanisms.",

      "phr_text": "Narrative\nThis study seeks to elucidate the impact of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) and alcohol exposure on\nmitochondrial metabolism during the recovery phase. Additionally, it investigates the potential of alcohol to\ntrigger ferroptosis, a specific cell death process, through mitochondrial pathways in the context of TBI recovery.\nThe research aims to provide insights into the complex interplay between TBI, alcohol, and mitochondrial\nprocesses, shedding light on potential mechanisms underlying cellular responses during the recovery period.",

      "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nAfrican Americans have both the highest incidence and mortality of lung cancer compared to any\nother racial/ethnic group. A possible explanation for this disparity is that African Americans (AA)\nmay be less likely to utilize preventative screenings such as Low-dose computed tomography\n(LDCT), which has the potential to encourage smokers to quit smoking successfully. In 2021, the\nUSPSTF expanded their lung cancer screening (LCS) recommendations to include individuals\nages 50-80 years with at least a 20 pack-year history, increasing the number of eligible U.S.\nadults. While the expanded criteria are expected to increase the number of high-risk individuals\neligible for screening and reduce lung cancer mortality, the impact on racial and ethnic minorities,\nincluding African Americans, has shown mixed findings. This is problematic as previous research\nhas found that African Americans may have different quit behaviors than whites. While use of\nLCS as a teachable moment for tobacco cessation is important, currently, there is no well-\nintegrated, comprehensive, culturally relevant community-engaged, sustainable program. Still, it\nis not clear whether the synergy effect of smoking cessation and LDCT LCS intervention was\nobserved in both quitting behaviors and LDCT uptake among African-American smokers. To\naddress this urgent public health concern, this study aims to reduce disparities and the burden of\nlung cancer among AA smokers by supporting a Multiple-level intervention integrating lung cancer\nscreening and smoking cessation(MILS), followed the NIH DEIA strategies using multilevel\ninterventions that impact determinants of health and address health disparities at appropriate time\npoints across the life course. Aim 1) Investigate smokers' and providers' attitudes, knowledge,\nand experiences with the expanded 2021 USPSTF LCS recommendations. Aim 2) Compare the\neffectiveness of a MILS vs. usual care on the biochemically-validated 7-day point-prevalence\ntobacco abstinence rates, LDCT uptake, nicotine dependence and stage of change was\nassessed. Aim 3) Explore barriers and facilitators that influence primary outcomes at the\ncommunity, provider, and individual levels for the improvement of a multilevel intervention. To\ndate, no study has evaluated the synergy effect of smoking cessation intervention and LDCT LCS\nin AA populations with multilevel strategies. We will move the field forward by providing effective,\nscalable interventions to improve both smoking cessation and LDCT lung cancer screening\nadherence to reduce health disparities promised by large clinical trials that motivated screening\nguidelines. The results of the study will directly guide the development of targeted strategies to\nimprove lung cancer screening rates among minorities.",

      "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT\nPeople living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (PLWH) remain at increased risk of developing\nhead and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC) due to oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, despite\nadequate management of HIV with effective antiretroviral therapy (ART). Clinical observations have indicated\nincreased risk of oral HPV infection and pathology in PLWH after they begin taking ART and concurrent with a\nsignificant drop in HIV viral burden. Prior in vitro studies using 3D experimental tissue models that mimic stratified\nsquamous epithelium have suggested that exposure of the tissue to ART agents disrupts the structural integrity\nof the tissue and enhances susceptibility to HPV infection. These findings have not been corroborated in clinical\nstudies using relevant oral mucosal samples from PLWH. We hypothesize that ART damages the integrity of the\noral mucosa and enhances acquisition of HPV infection in vivo. Further, we posit that individuals that are taking\nART for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent HIV infection will exhibit tissue damage and HPV\nsusceptibility similar to that of PLWH who are taking ART to manage their HIV infection. Three specific aims are\nproposed to investigate these hypotheses: 1) to compare the prevalence and incidence of oral HPV infection in\nPLWH taking ART and people taking ART for PrEP to risk-matched HIV seronegative, ART-na\u00efve controls; 2) to\nexamine the architecture of oral mucosal tissue in subjects taking ART/PrEP for evidence of damage to the\nintegrity of the mucosal barrier; and 3) to determine the effect of taking ART/PrEP on tissue susceptibility to HPV\ninfection by experimental challenge of patient oral biopsy-derived 3D tissues with HPV16 in vitro. These studies\nwill, for the first time, discern the role of ART apart from HIV infection on oral mucosa integrity and susceptibility\nto oral HPV infection. This is significant because understanding the interplay between HIV, ART and HPV will\nreveal new opportunities to prevent HNSCC that take into consideration the effects of ART on patient risk.",

      "abstract_text": "Pancreatic cancer is a lethal malignancy. Even with surgical resection, the recurrence rate is high, and chemotherapy is recommended for all patients due to the systemic nature of the disease. A major treatment challenge is the high rate of resistance to the available treatments. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop novel treatment modalities with effective and durable responses. Immunotherapy has recently revolutionized the treatment of several malignancies. While these patients have a durable response to immunotherapy and benefit from improved survival, many solid tumors and in particular, pancreatic cancer, do not respond to standard immunotherapy. They do not elicit a significant immune response and are considered immunologically \u201ccold\u201d tumors. A dense tumor microenvironment is a physical barrier against treatment delivery. It also suppresses the immune system to fight against cancer. Therefore, a multi-modality approach targeting tumor cells and tumor microenvironment can overcome treatment resistance more effectively. Converting \u201ccold\u201d tumors to \u201chot\u201d tumors is an area of great interest in immuno-oncology research. Oncolytic viruses are one of the desirable platforms for this purpose. Their anti-cancer activity is not only the direct killing of tumor cells but also modulating the immune response against cancer. In this project, we have designed novel oncolytic viruses, on a vesicular stomatitis virus backbone, that are bioengineered to express enzymes that target the stroma and tumor microenvironment. In addition, they express antibodies against the immune checkpoint LAG-3. Immune checkpoints inhibit immune response against tumors and by blocking them, they can prevent tumor evasion from the immune system. The combination of LAG-3 inhibition with conventional immune checkpoint inhibitors (PD-1 inhibitors) has been recently shown to enhance immunotherapy efficacy and reverse resistance to PD-1 inhibitors. We hypothesize that this multi-target design offers a comprehensive approach against important resistance mechanisms in pancreatic cancer and not only offers an effective immunotherapeutic approach but also improves the response to available conventional therapies. This study aims to investigate whether targeting the extracellular matrix with the oncolytic virus platform improves anti-tumor toxicity. It determines whether dual targeting of the tumor microenvironment and immune checkpoint inhibition with this oncolytic virus elicits an enhanced immune response. Finally, we will investigate whether combining this novel oncolytic virus with PD-1 inhibitors and standard chemotherapy can elicit safe and effective tumor toxicity and enhanced immune response and if the approach can convert the \u201ccold\u201d tumors to \u201chot\u201d tumors. Validating our hypothesis in preclinical models provides the required evidence for designing clinical trials that investigate the treatment efficacy and safety of this approach in pancreatic cancer patients. Establishing a successful immunotherapeutic approach can revolutionize the treatment of pancreatic cancer.",

      "abstract_text": "Despite the progress in the fight against HIV/AIDS, women around the world remain disproportionately\naffected by HIV. More than half of the HIV cases globally are women, and young women are as twice as\nlikely as young men to acquire HIV. Biological factors have all been suggested to increase women\u2019s risk to\nHIV, and are compounded by social factors such as stigma, social norms, and barriers to accessing sexual\nand reproductive health services. Consequently, women living with HIV (WLWH) experience mental health\nillnesses like stress, depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress symptoms at higher rates than their male\ncounterparts and more often than HIV-unaffected women. These mental health issues affect not only the\nwell-being and quality of life of WLWH but have implications for HIV management and transmission\nprevention. While mental illnesses have significant impact on management of HIV disease, data on the\nburden of mental illnesses and their impact in SSA where most of the PLHIV are residing is lacking. The lack\nof well-trained HIV researchers in mental health and women\u2019s health has also contributed to the low\nunderstanding of comorbidities affecting WLWH in SSA. Therefore, there is a need to build research capacity\nin HIV and mental health particularly among WLWH by investigating the impact of depression on health of\nWLWH in SSA countries like Tanzania, where HIV prevalence is still high at 4.4% in the general population\nbut higher in women at 5.6%. The ongoing Tanzania AIDS Malignancies Research and Training Program\nD43 (TW012277) provides a unique opportunity to train young investigators in the field of HIV-associated\nmalignancy research to address some of the challenges highlighted. We are proposing to mentor a junior\nfemale faculty oncologist who can lead a study in establishing the burden and impact of depression on health\nof WLWH in the country. We hypothesize that WLWH, especially those diagnosed with cancers, will have\nhigh rates of depression, and this condition will negatively influence their ability to control HIV disease. To\ntest this hypothesis, the team will: a) enroll women (HIV+/HIV-, and cancer+/cancer-) at Ocean Road Cancer\nInstitute in Tanzania and establish the burden of depression among WLWH by using a validated depression\nassessment tool, PHQ-9. Information on ART use and its adherence, CD4 counts, HIV viral load, and HIV\ndisease stage will also be systematically documented; b) assess the impact of depression on health of WLWH\nby analyzing severity of depression and how it affects outcomes of WLWH in terms of ART adherence, HIV\nplasma viral load suppression, and HIV disease stage. The proposed study will provide a unique opportunity\nfor a new investigator (Dr. Queen) to acquire new skills in HIV, mental health, and women\u2019s health research\nas a stepping-stone to embark on HIV/AIDS research career and improve research capacity in Tanzania.\nThe generated mental health and outcomes data will be important preliminary data for future research and\ncrucial in designing future strategies to improve health outcomes for WLWH in SSA and beyond.",

      "abstract_text": "Abstract\nThis NRSA F30 fellowship will provide the groundwork that will prepare the applicant for a career\nin academic medicine as a cardiothoracic anesthesiologist. Much of the applicant\u2019s career\ndevelopment will come from work in alcohol and cardiovascular-related research. Alcohol-related\nCardiomyopathy (AC) manifests in humans after excessive alcohol consumption and is\ncharacterized by ventricular dilation and cardiac function impairment. During cardiac inflammation\nand injury, fibroblasts differentiate into myofibroblasts, which are larger in cell size and express\nhigher levels of collagens and their crosslinking enzyme lysyl oxidase (LOX). Here, the role of\nTRAF3IP2, a proinflammatory cytoplasmic adapter protein, in the pathogenesis of AC is explored.\nPreliminary data indicates that exposure of na\u00efve cardiac fibroblasts (CF) to alcohol induces\nTRAF3IP2 protein expression in a time- and dose-dependent manner. In our studies, we will\ninvestigate whether i) alcohol-induced cardiac fibroblast activation, and proinflammatory cytokine\nand extracellular matrix expression are dependent on TRAF3IP2 and ii) global TRAF3IP2 gene\ndeletion prevents alcohol-induced cardiac inflammation, fibrosis, and dysfunction.\nThe cellular mechanism underlying alcohol-induced cardiac inflammation and fibrosis are\ninvestigated using both in vitro and in vivo alcohol exposure. In vitro, TRAF3IP2 is targeted using\nna\u00efve CF from wild-type mice transduced with TRAF3IP2 shRNA and CF isolated from\nhomozygous TRAF3IP2 knockout mice. In vivo, TRAF3IP2 is targeted using global TRAF3IP2-\nknockout mice on a 30-day Lieber-DeCarli or isocaloric control liquid diet based on the\nchronic+binge model. Endpoint measures include induction of proinflammatory and profibrotic\npathways.\nUsing the chronic+binge model of AC, TRAF3IP2-KO and littermate controls are exposed to\nchronic alcohol consumption. Endpoints include assessment of cardiac function and chamber\ndimensions by echocardiography and pressure-volume left ventricular catheterization. Markers of\ninflammation and fibrotic measures include collagens I and III, LOX expression, left ventricle total\ncollagen, and histological assessment of interstitial fibrosis by PSR staining.\nUltimately, these studies may identify novel, therapeutic targets for the treatment of alcohol-\nrelated cardiomyopathy. With the support of a strong mentoring team, completion of the proposed\nresearch and training plan will ensure that the applicant is prepared for an impactful career as a\nphysician-scientist.",

      "abstract_text": "Abstract\nAlcohol use disorder (AUD) affects more than 10% of the United States population. AUD is a psychiatric\ndisorder characterized by escalated alcohol drinking and the emergence of profound negative affective states,\nincluding persistent pain. Alcohol is also known for its analgesic effects, although excessive use facilitates pain\nsensitivity (or hyperalgesia) during withdrawal. While chronic pain affects over 20% of the global population\nand contributes to the development and severity of both psychiatric illness and AUD, effective pharmacological\ntreatments for these conditions remain very limited. In recent years, many people have turned to cannabis for\nmanagement of chronic pain and various negative emotional symptoms associated with mental illness.\nHowever, there is a significant gap in knowledge regarding the analgesic efficacy of primary cannabis\nconstituents in the context of alcohol dependence and how use may either mitigate or worsen the risk of\nsubstance use disorders. Specifically, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive component\nof cannabis, may offer a promising avenue for pain management, a common cause of excessive drinking in\nindividuals with AUD. From a neurobiological perspective, the extended amygdala (EA) plays an important role\nin stress- and pain-related components of AUD and is a site where the endocannabinoid (eCB) system\nappears critical for modulating the reinforcing effects of ethanol and transition to dependence. Our previous\npreclinical work has shown a functional role for the central amygdala (CeA), a constituent of the EA, as a key\nbrain region underlying hyperalgesia and escalation of alcohol drinking in alcohol-dependent animal models.\nOur preliminary data indicate an eCB system dysregulation generated by chronic alcohol exposure, which may\npromote the use of alcohol and imply the therapeutic efficacy of cannabis/THC in individuals suffering from\nAUD and AUD-related hyperalgesia. The main research objective of the current proposal is to investigate the\nintricate interplay between the endocannabinoid system, pain, and alcohol use. The studies outlined in this F30\ntraining proposal incorporate both animal modeling and clinical investigation to examine the predictions that: 1)\ndelta-9-THC administration alleviates hyperalgesia and reduces escalated alcohol self-administration in\nalcohol-dependent male and female rats, and 2) increased cannabis use is associated with overall reductions\nin pain symptoms and at-risk alcohol use in men and women. This proposal will provide a promising future\nphysician-scientist with vital research training to become an independent scientist in the field of alcohol and\nclinical neuroscience research.",
      "project_title": "Alcohol-Cannabinoid System Interactions in the Context of Pain and AUD",
      "phr_text": "Narrative\nThis NRSA F30 fellowship will provide an invaluable and comprehensive training opportunity for a future\nphysician-scientist as she develops into an emerging leader in the field of alcohol research and clinical\nneuroscience. These studies investigate important interactions among alcohol, cannabis, and pain in both\nanimals and humans. Findings from this research will provide valuable insight for future translational studies and\ntherapeutic applications aimed at alleviating alcohol use disorder (AUD)-associated pain.",
